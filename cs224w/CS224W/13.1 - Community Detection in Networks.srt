1
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,080
So today, we are going to talk about,

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,435
er, community detection in networks.

3
00:00:09,435 --> 00:00:12,420
So basically, what community detection is,

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,120
is essentially clustering a set of nodes,

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,335
uh, in a graph.

6
00:00:16,335 --> 00:00:18,180
So, uh, this is what we are, uh,

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,585
going to do today and the clustering we are going

8
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:24,990
to do will be based on the net structure,

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,790
er, of the network.

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,250
So, let's start, uh,

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,360
by defining this pro-, er,

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,720
problem of community detection and then I'm going actually to talk to you about-

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,380
about some social science research that explains why do we see these,

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,180
uh, clusters in networks,

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,605
why do they make sense,

16
00:00:43,605 --> 00:00:46,805
and they actually inform the development of the methods,

17
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:48,320
er, to be able to do this.

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,610
So, um, when we write,

19
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,130
er, or when we draw, er, networks, let's say,

20
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,730
on a- on a piece of paper, we often, er,

21
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,700
would like to think of them to have kind of the following,

22
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,320
uh, the following structure, right?

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,140
We think of them as having these, uh, clusters,

24
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,600
these communities where the- the edges inside the cluster are more,

25
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,355
um, are more than the edges, er,

26
00:01:10,355 --> 00:01:13,010
spanning, uh, across, uh, the clusters.

27
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,910
And this is kind of how intuitively we like to think of networks,

28
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,090
in particular social networks perhaps where

29
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,435
these types of clusters could correspond to social communities.

30
00:01:23,435 --> 00:01:26,200
We think of them in terms of- in biological networks.

31
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,750
We can think of these as some kind of, uh, functional units,

32
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,680
modules that are there to do a certain task, um, and so on.

33
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,460
So, we'd like to think that the networks are not just kind of messy objects,

34
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,725
but that they have this kind of clustering, uh, org- organization.

35
00:01:41,725 --> 00:01:43,560
So the question is,

36
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,900
how did this picture, uh, arise?

37
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,430
What kind of evidence do we have that these types of structure

38
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,200
actually appears in networks and what could be some reasons for it?

39
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,470
So, um, here is one way to think about this from the viewpoint of, er, social networks.

40
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,120
So right now what we'll do is we're going to do a bit of

41
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,320
a dive in into classical social science and classical,

42
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,245
er, social network analysis.

43
00:02:08,245 --> 00:02:09,514
So the question is,

44
00:02:09,514 --> 00:02:12,710
how does information flow through networks?

45
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,360
Think of a social network, right,

46
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,750
where basically we have people connected in a social network and

47
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,350
there are different links over which the information flows.

48
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,830
And let's call these links short and long.

49
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,750
Um, and let's call them, you know,

50
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,550
short as the ones that kind of are- are a very kind of, er, local.

51
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,109
These are strong friendships,

52
00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:36,950
and let's also have these long links that you- which we can think of as

53
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,820
links to our acquaintances and kind of colleagues and people we,

54
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,815
let's say, meet, uh, less often.

55
00:02:42,815 --> 00:02:45,080
And the way we can think of this is that, you know,

56
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,405
we have these short, er, short, er,

57
00:02:47,405 --> 00:02:49,505
strong links and we have these weak, er,

58
00:02:49,505 --> 00:02:51,920
long links, er, to other parts,

59
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,365
er, of the network.

60
00:02:53,365 --> 00:02:56,520
So, uh, there was a seminal work, er,

61
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,000
back in 1960s, uh, by Mark Granovetter,

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,510
who's a sociologist here at Stanford University,

63
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,070
and this is I think the most,

64
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,380
er, cited and the most impactful,

65
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,675
uh, social science paper ever.

66
00:03:08,675 --> 00:03:12,320
And this is really about his research during his PhD,

67
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,940
where he was asking about,

68
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:18,040
how do people find information through personal contacts?

69
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,695
Um, and, um, what- he was looking at this,

70
00:03:21,695 --> 00:03:23,465
how people find jobs.

71
00:03:23,465 --> 00:03:29,270
So he was asking people who were on the job market to basically- and have found a job to,

72
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,820
er, to tell him, where did you hear about this job?

73
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,440
Which, er, which person did you tell- tell you about- about this job opening?

74
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,225
How did you apply, things like that.

75
00:03:38,225 --> 00:03:41,600
And, uh, what was interesting is that, um,

76
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,410
contacts through which these people heard for job openings and

77
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,050
found jobs were more often acquaintances than,

78
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,000
let's say, close friends, right?

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,150
So it wasn't that you would, uh,

80
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,715
hear that people heard about new job openings

81
00:03:55,715 --> 00:03:59,030
from people they have very strong relationship with that, you know,

82
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,845
they spend a lot of time together,

83
00:04:00,845 --> 00:04:04,280
but they heard about new job openings through these,

84
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:10,710
um, acquaintances, people that would- they would kind of meet less, uh, more rarely.

85
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,220
Um, and this is very surprising because you

86
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,350
would imagine that it is actually your friends,

87
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,070
people you have strong, er, relationships with,

88
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,130
whose- whose best interest is to help you,

89
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,210
who are closest to you,

90
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,435
who are the most motivated to help you find,

91
00:04:26,435 --> 00:04:28,385
uh, a job, to connect you,

92
00:04:28,385 --> 00:04:30,250
uh, with the job openings, and so on.

93
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,390
But what turned out was that it was actually

94
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:36,180
casual acquaintances who- who- through which,

95
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,815
um, through whom, uh,

96
00:04:37,815 --> 00:04:41,610
the- these job seekers found about, er, new jobs.

97
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,940
So what this means is if we go back to the- to the picture that we had before,

98
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,170
it was that- basically,

99
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,530
it was this- these types of,

100
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,060
let say, acquaintance links,

101
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,470
these weak links, uh,

102
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,965
to- to have, uh,

103
00:04:52,965 --> 00:04:56,000
to be the ones through which people heard about the jobs and

104
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,570
not necessarily these kind of strong, uh, interpersonal links.

105
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,330
So this means that acquaintances are more,

106
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,790
uh, were more helpful in this process.

107
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,625
And the question was, why?

108
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:13,435
And Granovetter gave these two perspective on a friendship or on a link in the network.

109
00:05:13,435 --> 00:05:20,015
So the first struct- the- the first perspective on a link in the network is structural.

110
00:05:20,015 --> 00:05:24,260
It's about, what is the structural role of a link in the network?

111
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,355
So you can think about,

112
00:05:25,355 --> 00:05:29,690
what is the structural role of a friendship in a social network, right?

113
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:33,650
We can think about this particular edge being this kind of, um,

114
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,840
connecting different parts of the network,

115
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,070
while this particular other edge being very well embedded,

116
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,600
uh, inside the network, right?

117
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,620
Having all these common friends and being a really strong, uh, relationship.

118
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,735
So that's kind of structural.

119
00:05:47,735 --> 00:05:51,095
And then there is also the interpersonal, er,

120
00:05:51,095 --> 00:05:53,420
view which is about, er,

121
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,660
friendships being either kind of strong or weak, right?

122
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,125
Having a very strong relationship with someone or having a much,

123
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,910
er, weaker relationship with,

124
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,695
uh, uh, each other.

125
00:06:03,695 --> 00:06:09,380
And, uh, what Granovetter shows is that structural and interpersonal,

126
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,245
uh, relationship of the link,

127
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,185
they- they are connected.

128
00:06:13,185 --> 00:06:15,870
They- they are related to each other.

129
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,075
So, uh, let me explain how.

130
00:06:18,075 --> 00:06:22,670
So first, uh, point is that Granovetter makes the connection between the

131
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:27,440
social and the structural role of an edge and shows that they are related,

132
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,320
they are correlated, they are connected.

133
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,950
So first is the structural point, right?

134
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,175
The structural, um, edge from, uh, er,

135
00:06:35,175 --> 00:06:38,250
from the point of e- edge being in the network, um,

136
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,640
he basically say- shows that structurally embedded edges,

137
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,770
so edges, uh, that,

138
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,825
uh, that happen among co-, er,

139
00:06:45,825 --> 00:06:48,140
in the- in the densely-linked parts

140
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,615
of the network where there is a lot of common friends,

141
00:06:50,615 --> 00:06:55,385
that these edges tend to be strong edges like inter-personally strong.

142
00:06:55,385 --> 00:06:59,855
And that these long-range edges that kind of connect the different parts of the network,

143
00:06:59,855 --> 00:07:03,135
they tend to be socially weak, right?

144
00:07:03,135 --> 00:07:05,355
So, um, what does this mean?

145
00:07:05,355 --> 00:07:07,240
This means that, um,

146
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,380
there is a relationship between the strength of

147
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,075
the relationship and the structure of the relationship.

148
00:07:13,075 --> 00:07:16,375
So strength means, uh, strong links, er,

149
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:19,100
between people who have a lot of friends in common,

150
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,450
and weak links connecting different parts of the network, right?

151
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:27,800
So weak friendships are ge- generally the ones that

152
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,900
connect different parts of the network and strong friendships are the ones that- that,

153
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,730
uh, where you have, um,

154
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,380
a lot of friends in common, and so on.

155
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,180
And what I want to say is,

156
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,570
strong friendship is not defined by having a lot of friends in common.

157
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,280
You can ask someone who are your strongest friends,

158
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,100
and then if you check in the social network,

159
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,905
you will see these are the people you have a lot of friends in common.

160
00:07:48,905 --> 00:07:52,430
So these are the structurally strong, uh,

161
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:58,080
structurally well embedded relationships are socially strong and structurally,

162
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,615
um, uh, kind of di- the relationships that connect different parts of the network,

163
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,210
they are socially weak.

164
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,530
So those are- those are two connections,

165
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,480
two important aspects of a relationship.

166
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,940
So social strength of a relationship and

167
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,585
a structural role or position of the relationship,

168
00:08:14,585 --> 00:08:16,030
that's the first point.

169
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,765
And then, the second important point that

170
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:22,120
Granovetter makes is this notion of information flow.

171
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,490
And he says that long-range edges allow you to gather

172
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,910
information from very different distant parts,

173
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,205
uh, of the network.

174
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:32,570
Uh, and this means that now you have access to

175
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:37,429
all these distant information that can come to you and can be very useful to you, right?

176
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:40,489
And, er, he says that structurally embedded edges are

177
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,159
heavily re- redundant in terms of information access, right?

178
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,570
So if you think that, I don't know,

179
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,400
this person A is, uh,

180
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,050
is an edge in the network and they are looking for, er, jobs, yes,

181
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,810
they have these three strong, uh,

182
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,050
social relationships with these three- three other people,

183
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:00,185
but essentially, these relationships are very redundant, right?

184
00:09:00,185 --> 00:09:02,915
Whatever, uh, one of these people knows,

185
00:09:02,915 --> 00:09:05,430
they can either tell them to node A directly,

186
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,590
or perhaps, you know,

187
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,110
they are going through casual conversations sa- tell it

188
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,900
to this other node who's going to tell it to node A.

189
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,180
So in terms of information access,

190
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,585
these edges are heavily redundant.

191
00:09:16,585 --> 00:09:19,220
Well, for example, this weak long-range

192
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,595
edge to some other part of the network to this node B,

193
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:26,045
this is a very useful edge because it gives you access to

194
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:30,050
all this information from these other, uh, community.

195
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,180
So this is the second point,

196
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,230
is that strongly embedded edges are information redundant and it

197
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:40,590
is weak edges that give you access to very dif- distant parts,

198
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,849
uh, of the relationship,

199
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:43,230
uh, of the network.

200
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:48,605
Um, and this is important because if you look how social networks evolve, um,

201
00:09:48,605 --> 00:09:51,365
they evolve such as the communities form,

202
00:09:51,365 --> 00:09:56,630
in a sense that net- tightly-connected clusters of nodes naturally form.

203
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,135
And the reason for this is that, um,

204
00:09:59,135 --> 00:10:02,380
the networks tend to evolve using triadic closure.

205
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,910
What that means is that,

206
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,825
if you have two friends in common,

207
00:10:05,825 --> 00:10:07,400
you know, A has a friend B,

208
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,975
and A has a friend C,

209
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:14,010
then sooner or later A and B are going to meet and they are going to create,

210
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,640
uh, a link with each other.

211
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,290
Another important aspect is that we like to

212
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,130
connect with others that are similar to us, right?

213
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:24,260
So if I am, I don't know, a computer scientist,

214
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,870
or maybe I like soccer, football, right?

215
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,850
Maybe I play football with node B,

216
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:31,760
probably I may- play football with node C as well,

217
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,760
so they already will have something in common so they can,

218
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,780
uh, form that relationship, right?

219
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,130
So this is, um,

220
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:43,100
an important thing is that because we like to connect to others that are similar to us,

221
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,485
so if I'm connected to two other people,

222
00:10:45,485 --> 00:10:47,990
they likely share some similarities,

223
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,385
some aspects to myself.

224
00:10:49,385 --> 00:10:53,110
This means that they're alw- also going to share that similarity,

225
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,345
so they'll be more likely to bond,

226
00:10:55,345 --> 00:10:57,345
uh, and create, uh, an edge.

227
00:10:57,345 --> 00:10:58,920
So it means in networks,

228
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,855
these are the edges that,

229
00:11:00,855 --> 00:11:03,000
uh, that ha- that like to form.

230
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,170
So for example, uh,

231
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,900
A to B is a likely edge, um, and, you know,

232
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,810
to- also A to C because there is a fr- a common friend,

233
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,485
uh, B, uh, in between.

234
00:11:11,485 --> 00:11:14,075
So these are examples of edges that, uh, uh,

235
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:17,690
that are-, uh, happen to in social networks, uh, a lot.

236
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,790
So now, you know,

237
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:23,540
why is- why are some reasons that these types of edges happen?

238
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:29,330
Because if you remember early on we were talking about clustering coefficient, right?

239
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:32,720
The fraction of your neighbors that are connected with each other.

240
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,100
And this is essentially a metric of this notion of a triadic closure.

241
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,340
Because if we have this simple network structure,

242
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,080
uh, here, uh, on the right,

243
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,475
then you can say, you know,

244
00:11:43,475 --> 00:11:46,625
if B and C have a friend A in common,

245
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,865
so why should B and C link to each other?

246
00:11:49,865 --> 00:11:52,280
First is, they are more likely to meet each

247
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,965
other because they have this common friend,

248
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:57,710
uh, A, and maybe he invites them both,

249
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,210
uh, for the coffee or something.

250
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:03,260
Second thing is B and C are more likely to trust each other because again,

251
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,840
they have this common friend that they both trust so they say,

252
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,175
"Oh, you have this guy, uh,

253
00:12:07,175 --> 00:12:09,320
as a friend, I- I like him,

254
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,765
you like him, obviously we have something in common."

255
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:14,330
And then there is also another important point,

256
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:17,060
which is A has incentive to bring,

257
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,040
uh, B, and C together, right?

258
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,990
Because from A's point of view,

259
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,285
it is hard or costly,

260
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:26,060
it requires effort to maintain, uh,

261
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,520
two relationships, uh, together,

262
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,395
uh, for, uh for, uh, Node A.

263
00:12:31,395 --> 00:12:33,610
So if there is a triangle,

264
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,695
so if A links to B, B links to C,

265
00:12:35,695 --> 00:12:40,080
then all of them basically can go and hang out together because they are all friends.

266
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,950
So these are reasons for, uh, triadic closure.

267
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:45,185
And that is an important aspect,

268
00:12:45,185 --> 00:12:49,715
is that actually social science research shows that being embedded,

269
00:12:49,715 --> 00:12:54,215
having a lot of the strong edges and a lot of triangles around you,

270
00:12:54,215 --> 00:12:56,915
um, is, uh, is, ah, is, ah,

271
00:12:56,915 --> 00:13:01,040
kind of, um, is- is- is easier, warmer, um,

272
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,915
it's, ah, this is what,

273
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:05,165
ah, what humans, ah, seek for.

274
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:06,560
And actually, for example,

275
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,660
there is a famous study, um,

276
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,790
of, uh, teenage girls who have,

277
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,995
for example, low clustering coefficient.

278
00:13:12,995 --> 00:13:16,370
They are, uh, they are found to more likely contemplate suicide.

279
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:21,290
So basically right, it is hard to not have friends who are friends with each other.

280
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:24,575
So it's good to be well embedded in social clusters.

281
00:13:24,575 --> 00:13:26,705
That's kind of the social structures, uh,

282
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,850
we humans, uh, seek.

283
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,850
So now, uh, this, uh,

284
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:36,500
Granovetter explanation was a theory from the 60's, right?

285
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,330
Basically what he said was the following.

286
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:42,260
He said, edges that are embedded in the network,

287
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,555
so edges that have high clustering coefficient,

288
00:13:44,555 --> 00:13:46,370
edges that have a lot of,

289
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,690
uh, friends in common,

290
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,430
edges that uh, uh,

291
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,485
appear in dense parts of the network,

292
00:13:51,485 --> 00:13:54,845
these edges tend to be socially strong.

293
00:13:54,845 --> 00:13:58,295
And edges that connect distant parts of the network,

294
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,320
they tend to be socially weak.

295
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,515
Um, and this is a prediction he made,

296
00:14:03,515 --> 00:14:05,600
um, based on his research,

297
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,900
but it was left untested for,

298
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,269
er, 40 plus years.

299
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:15,410
And actually it was only in 2007 that this theory, uh,

300
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:21,740
was actually, uh, kind of validated on real large-scale data.

301
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,345
And the study is based on cell phone,

302
00:14:26,345 --> 00:14:29,090
uh, data, uh, from one of the European countries.

303
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,610
So where you say the strength of a relationship,

304
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,565
strength of an edge will be the number of phone calls,

305
00:14:34,565 --> 00:14:37,400
um, that- that we make in a given period, right?

306
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,520
And the idea is that people who are strong friends with you will make

307
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,195
a lot of phone calls with and people you are more acquaintances with,

308
00:14:44,195 --> 00:14:46,820
maybe you call them for Christmas, uh, and, you know,

309
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,620
wish them a Happy New Year, for example,

310
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,530
that would be, you know, once in a year type of, uh, phone call.

311
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:56,165
So the prediction from Granovetter would be that strong edges should be, uh,

312
00:14:56,165 --> 00:15:01,280
these edges with lots of phone calls should be clustered together in, uh, small pockets,

313
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,460
and then these edges that, uh, that, uh,

314
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,440
that span across different parts of the network,

315
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,465
there the number of,

316
00:15:08,465 --> 00:15:11,090
uh, um, uh, phone calls, uh, will be smaller.

317
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:14,450
That's the prediction. The way- the way, uh,

318
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,045
this was operationalized was first to say,

319
00:15:17,045 --> 00:15:18,830
um, the notion of, uh, you know,

320
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:23,030
how, uh, how strong or weak is the edge structurally,

321
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:26,585
uh, and you quantify this by the metric called edge overlap.

322
00:15:26,585 --> 00:15:27,725
And simply you ask,

323
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:32,840
what is the fraction of neighbors that edge endpoints have in common, right?

324
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,070
So for example here,

325
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:40,760
the edge overlap is 0 because these nodes i and j have no friends in common,

326
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,080
while here, for example,

327
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,595
this is an overlap of 1 because they have all these- all these neighbors,

328
00:15:46,595 --> 00:15:49,640
each of them, and they are both mutually connected to all of them.

329
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,570
So here we would say this edge is very well embedded, uh,

330
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,505
it is structurally strong,

331
00:15:55,505 --> 00:15:58,280
and this edge is structurally weak, right?

332
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,910
It kind of connects to different parts of the network that don't know each other.

333
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,095
Right? And then, um,

334
00:16:05,095 --> 00:16:10,210
what Granovetter would say that when edges have low overlap, the, um,

335
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:14,615
the number of phone calls will be very small and when edges have high overlap,

336
00:16:14,615 --> 00:16:18,845
the number of, uh, phone calls, uh, will be very high.

337
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:22,160
Here is now the, uh, the result.

338
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,540
Uh, this is the edge strength in terms of number of phone calls.

339
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,865
Uh, and this is the neighborhood overlap.

340
00:16:28,865 --> 00:16:30,785
Uh, and this is the real data.

341
00:16:30,785 --> 00:16:34,805
And what you see is that the strong- the more the phone calls,

342
00:16:34,805 --> 00:16:36,215
the higher the overlap,

343
00:16:36,215 --> 00:16:38,855
which means that highly used links,

344
00:16:38,855 --> 00:16:42,110
links where a lot of phone calls happen have high overlap, right?

345
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:45,395
So links where there is a high number of,

346
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:48,335
uh, phone calls, uh, look like this,

347
00:16:48,335 --> 00:16:52,280
and links where there is a lower number or phone calls have smaller overlap,

348
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,280
so they are structurally, uh, like that.

349
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,490
Um, and then here what, also, uh,

350
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,310
they show is an example of a null model

351
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:04,310
where they would basically keep the network structure the same,

352
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,250
but randomly reassign the edge strands.

353
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,005
And then you see that there is no,

354
00:17:09,005 --> 00:17:10,910
uh, relationship, just two, uh,

355
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,859
and this is expected and it's just kind

356
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:17,059
of a safety check to make sure that this analysis makes sense.

357
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,935
So what this means is that, you know,

358
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:20,165
the bigger the overlap,

359
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:22,925
the stronger the edge personally.

360
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:26,105
To give you a picture that is even more telling

361
00:17:26,105 --> 00:17:29,105
is that here is a part of this phone call network.

362
00:17:29,105 --> 00:17:32,000
And this is the strength of the edge.

363
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,220
Red is very strong and yellow,

364
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,655
green is- is weak in terms of number of phone calls.

365
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:40,565
And what you see is that these red edges

366
00:17:40,565 --> 00:17:43,850
tend to happen in these kind of small clumps here.

367
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,040
And you see that these long edges,

368
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,300
they are mostly yellow,

369
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:51,980
which means there is a small number of phone calls that happens over them.

370
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,100
And just to show you the contrast, now,

371
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,320
I will show you the picture of the same network,

372
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,540
but I'm going to randomly shuffle,

373
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,150
uh, edge strengths across the same structure.

374
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:05,255
Um, and what you will see is that now all of a sudden,

375
00:18:05,255 --> 00:18:07,730
this is how the network, uh, looks like, right?

376
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:12,800
So if I randomly assign edge strengths according to the real edge strengths,

377
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,830
you see how now these long-range- long-range edges,

378
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:19,280
all of a sudden start to look, uh, red.

379
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,640
And why is this? This is the reason because there is a lot of

380
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,310
edges- strong grid edges hidden in

381
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:28,430
these clusters and they jus- you just don't get to see them.

382
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:32,030
Uh, and these all these long-range edges, they are all yellow.

383
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,430
They all have very small numbers or phone calls in them.

384
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:38,720
But if you now take these edge strengths and randomly permute them,

385
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,000
randomly assign them over the edges,

386
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,265
then this is how the network would look like.

387
00:18:43,265 --> 00:18:45,230
Like all of a sudden, uh,

388
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,060
you see that there is actually a lot of long-range,

389
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:51,530
er, red edges that we don't- just don't see in, uh, practice.

390
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,600
So what does this mean?

391
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,030
Uh, this means that,

392
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,205
uh, edges that are strong, uh,

393
00:18:58,205 --> 00:19:02,914
interpersonally appear in clu- in densely knit clusters,

394
00:19:02,914 --> 00:19:06,590
and edges that are weak connect different parts,

395
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,210
uh, of the network.

396
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:12,335
And, uh, another experiment to validate this is to say,

397
00:19:12,335 --> 00:19:18,230
what if I take my network and I remove edges one by one, uh, uh,

398
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,885
by the decreasing, um, sorry,

399
00:19:20,885 --> 00:19:24,260
by the increasing number of, uh, phone calls, right?

400
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,720
First I will remove edges with one phone call,

401
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,700
then two phone calls and so on.

402
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,795
And then here is how I'm removing edges.

403
00:19:32,795 --> 00:19:34,250
And here he is, uh,

404
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:38,870
how does my network fall apart into different connected components, right?

405
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,775
So as I'm removing edges,

406
00:19:40,775 --> 00:19:43,655
the network will start to get disconnected.

407
00:19:43,655 --> 00:19:49,940
And what you notice is that if I remove uh,

408
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,750
first the edges that have low number of phone calls,

409
00:19:53,750 --> 00:20:00,050
the- the network is going to fall apart into multiple disconnected components,

410
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,300
um, much faster, if I would,

411
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,660
for example, remove, uh, highly, um, uh,

412
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:11,525
edges that are highly used because those edges are embedded in these- in these clusters.

413
00:20:11,525 --> 00:20:13,265
So even if I remove them,

414
00:20:13,265 --> 00:20:14,810
I don't disconnect the network.

415
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:17,300
But if I disconnect- if I remove these weak edges,

416
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,510
then the network gets disconnected, uh, faster.

417
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,095
The largest connected component is smaller,

418
00:20:23,095 --> 00:20:26,350
so the red line is below, uh, the black line.

419
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,480
Um, um, an- and then if I do something

420
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,095
similar according let's say now out to the edge overlap where I say,

421
00:20:33,095 --> 00:20:36,035
let's remove edges with low overlap first,

422
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:41,074
you see how now the largest connected component super quickly, uh, gets destroyed,

423
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:44,915
which basically the intuition is that if I remove the slow overlap edges,

424
00:20:44,915 --> 00:20:48,155
very quickly, uh, I get these separate islands,

425
00:20:48,155 --> 00:20:50,885
separate disconnected, uh, components.

426
00:20:50,885 --> 00:20:52,790
So, um, you know,

427
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,010
why- why did we spend, uh,

428
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:57,785
uh, these 20 minutes discussing about all these?

429
00:20:57,785 --> 00:20:59,630
Like what did we learn?

430
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,985
What we learned is that

431
00:21:01,985 --> 00:21:06,770
this conceptual picture of networks that I try to sh- that I show here,

432
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:10,340
um, is actually well-grounded in sociological,

433
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,530
uh, processes and social science.

434
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:18,890
What we have also found out is that the interpersonal strength of a relationship and its,

435
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,900
uh, overlap, it, uh,

436
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,790
embedding in the network,

437
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:25,130
uh, are related, right?

438
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,915
So we- we showed,

439
00:21:26,915 --> 00:21:29,420
uh, that these type of, uh,

440
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,870
nodes, uh, and these types of edges that have high overlap,

441
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:35,105
that have a lot of friends in common,

442
00:21:35,105 --> 00:21:38,660
these tend to be interpersonally strong connections

443
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:42,560
and that edges with low overlap or zero overlap,

444
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,500
that kind of connect different parts of the network,

445
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,805
they tend to be weak,

446
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,860
they tend to be, um, you know,

447
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,755
um, don't have high, uh, strength.

448
00:21:51,755 --> 00:21:54,335
So, uh, this is now, uh,

449
00:21:54,335 --> 00:22:00,395
very cool because this intuition can serve us to identify this type of, uh,

450
00:22:00,395 --> 00:22:03,455
bridge connections and be able to, uh,

451
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,870
separate and be able to identify,

452
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:09,090
uh, the clusters, uh, in the network.
