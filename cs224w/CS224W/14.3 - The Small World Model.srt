1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,870
Now that we have looked at,

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,010
uh, the G_np model.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,920
Let's move on and talk about the small-world model,

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,510
and the small-world model,

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,780
um, what- the goal of it will be- it,

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,675
uh, it will try to- to give us two things.

7
00:00:18,675 --> 00:00:21,930
It will try to give us the average shortest path length to be small,

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,740
but it will also give us high clustering coefficient.

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,310
And the- the point why this is interesting,

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,990
because these two forces kind of go one against the other, right?

11
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,570
You get shortest path length to be small.

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,580
If you have a random graph where we have a lot of

13
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,510
these random connections everywhere, right?

14
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,609
But then if you have a lot of random connections,

15
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:48,770
you have- you- you have low clustering coefficient as we see in, uh, G_np, right?

16
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:51,570
So if you want low diameter, uh,

17
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,010
be like G_np's, but the problem is you have no triangles,

18
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,615
you have no local structure.

19
00:00:56,615 --> 00:00:58,735
So we have low clustering coefficient.

20
00:00:58,735 --> 00:00:59,990
If you have, let's say

21
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,630
a very irregular network like this lattice where, you know,

22
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,315
uh, you have this triangle,

23
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:07,025
so you have quite high clustering coefficient.

24
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:11,420
Everything seems nice, but now the diameter of this thing will be long because it

25
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,800
takes a huge number of steps to get from one corner to the other corner.

26
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,765
So kind of the tangent is the following,

27
00:01:17,765 --> 00:01:20,630
is that regular lattice type grounds they have

28
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:25,325
high clustering coefficient because nearby nodes are connected to each other.

29
00:01:25,325 --> 00:01:29,510
The problem with the structure is that it has high diameter.

30
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,340
You know, on the other hand,

31
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,175
random graphs have no local structure,

32
00:01:34,175 --> 00:01:36,215
have low clustering, which is bad,

33
00:01:36,215 --> 00:01:37,789
but they have low diameter,

34
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:39,950
which we also find in real networks.

35
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,705
So the big question is,

36
00:01:41,705 --> 00:01:42,850
can I have both?

37
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:47,945
Can I have a small diameter but still a lot of clustering coefficient,

38
00:01:47,945 --> 00:01:50,750
a lot of this local clustering structure,

39
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,890
a lot of triangles,

40
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,070
a lot of friend of a friend is my friend type,

41
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,130
uh, structures in the network.

42
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:03,920
So, um, the point is that this clustering implies what we call edge locality, right?

43
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,940
It basically, um, it implies that friend of a friend is a friend, right?

44
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,430
So it means that if two people, um,

45
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,720
have a friend in common,

46
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,850
then that is more likely to be edge there.

47
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,995
But the problem is that this edge is now just

48
00:02:15,995 --> 00:02:18,950
locally connecting two people that are already connected.

49
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,850
And you cannot use this edge to connect different parts of the network.

50
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,995
So your diameter becomes large.

51
00:02:24,995 --> 00:02:29,240
And we saw that the MSN network has seven orders of magnitude,

52
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,230
larger clustering coefficient, then the corresponding random graph, right?

53
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,820
So it's a huge difference, right?

54
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,100
So 0.11 is massive.

55
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,860
It's a massive clustering coefficient, right?

56
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,250
And to give you an example in- in- in other- for other cases,

57
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,700
for example, this is a movie actor collaboration network.

58
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,305
Here the- I'm telling you the average shortest path length, uh,

59
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:53,390
on- in the actual graph versus

60
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,860
the random graph with the same number of nodes and the same number of edges.

61
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,515
Um, and you see that, you know, average, uh,

62
00:02:59,515 --> 00:03:02,300
shortest path lengths correspond quite nicely

63
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,920
between the actual graph and the random graph.

64
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,335
While here I have clustering coefficient between the actual graph, and the random graph.

65
00:03:09,335 --> 00:03:12,635
And you see that that is orders of magnitude difference,

66
00:03:12,635 --> 00:03:14,070
at least one order of magnitude.

67
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,515
So at least factor 10,

68
00:03:15,515 --> 00:03:17,390
if not, you know, a few hundred, um,

69
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,670
between the actual clustering coefficient,

70
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,580
and the clustering coefficient in the corresponding random graph.

71
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,375
And this is between movie collaboration networks,

72
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,855
uh, electronic power grid, uh,

73
00:03:27,855 --> 00:03:32,000
you know, stuff that the ways wires are connected to provide power,

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,500
like power to Texas.

75
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,965
Uh, and the C. elegans network, uh, which, uh,

76
00:03:36,965 --> 00:03:42,900
is now a network of how neurons in the C. elegans worm are connected with each other.

77
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,890
And again, in all cases you see we have relatively short

78
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:50,060
shortest paths as nicely captured by an Erdos-Renyi random graph,

79
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:55,015
but the clustering coefficient is far higher than what a random graph gives us.

80
00:03:55,015 --> 00:03:58,695
So the controversy, or the contradiction,

81
00:03:58,695 --> 00:04:02,445
or something that is unclear is- is the following, right?

82
00:04:02,445 --> 00:04:04,430
The consequence of expansion,

83
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,490
is that shortest paths exist, right?

84
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:11,180
This means basically that networks that have high expansion, um,

85
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,250
have small diameter because we can,

86
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,690
uh, get it, uh,

87
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:18,745
if we, uh, by simply traversing, uh, the graph.

88
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:22,350
But the problem with- with expansion and problem when

89
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,835
you- when you have short paths is that you have no clustering.

90
00:04:26,835 --> 00:04:28,920
You have no local structure.

91
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,660
Um, triadic closure, meaning friend of a friend is

92
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,550
my friend type behavior leads to this local clustering of edges, right?

93
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,835
You have this edge that is close to the friend of a friend.

94
00:04:40,835 --> 00:04:43,580
But the problem is that with high clustering.

95
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:48,289
You run out of the edges that would serve us kind of shortcuts across,

96
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:50,345
uh, different parts of the network.

97
00:04:50,345 --> 00:04:53,180
And the problem then becomes that your clustering,

98
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,359
yes would be very high because you close a lot of triangles.

99
00:04:56,359 --> 00:05:00,380
But the problem will be that now your diameter is high as well,

100
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,940
because it takes a long time to navigate from one part of the network to the other.

101
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,525
So the big question is, can we have both?

102
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:10,835
Um, and here's the idea.

103
00:05:10,835 --> 00:05:12,890
The idea is that we wanna interpolate between

104
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:16,575
regular lattice graphs and G_np, uh, random graphs.

105
00:05:16,575 --> 00:05:20,720
And, uh, the model that allows us to do this is called the small-world model.

106
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,670
And it will actually lead to high- to high clustering coefficient and low diameter.

107
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,580
So basically we will borrow the best from both sides.

108
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,290
We are going to have local structure,

109
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,380
so we have high clustering coefficient and we are going also to

110
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,695
have shortcuts so that we have, uh, low diameter.

111
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:38,710
So how do we achieve this?

112
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:42,465
So G_np, um, has two, uh,

113
00:05:42,465 --> 00:05:46,505
sorry, uh, the small- the small-world model has two components.

114
00:05:46,505 --> 00:05:52,380
First is- we wanna start with the low-dimensional regular lattice like a set of nodes,

115
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,510
uh, on a circle.

116
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,395
And here a node connects with its immediate neighbors and neighbors of neighbors.

117
00:05:57,395 --> 00:06:00,200
So that's why this will have high clustering coefficient,

118
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,640
but also notice it has high diameter because to get from one- one node to the other,

119
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,925
you have to kind of navigate around this, uh, circle.

120
00:06:07,925 --> 00:06:09,815
So I have high clustering,

121
00:06:09,815 --> 00:06:11,480
I have high diameter.

122
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,340
What I will do now is,

123
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,885
I will do in the second phase,

124
00:06:14,885 --> 00:06:16,550
I'm going to introduce some randomness.

125
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,725
I'm going to introduce shortcuts.

126
00:06:18,725 --> 00:06:21,920
And what this means is that I'm going to add and remove

127
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,680
edges to create shortcuts between the remote pairs,

128
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,200
uh, on the- on the lattice- on the circle.

129
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,070
So basically for each edge with probability p,

130
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,235
I'm going to move the endpoint to a random node.

131
00:06:34,235 --> 00:06:35,570
So the idea is that, you know,

132
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:39,560
I pick a- a- a random edge and I take one of its, uh,

133
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,670
endpoints and select it at random and rewire that edge to the other end.

134
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,840
So this would mean that for example,

135
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,745
this edge from black to, uh,

136
00:06:46,745 --> 00:06:49,050
from blue to black, I would rewire.

137
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,775
It still touches the blue,

138
00:06:50,775 --> 00:06:54,150
but it now connects to some other, uh, random node.

139
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,120
And then this is p, right?

140
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,890
Then the way you can think of it is,

141
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,375
um, on the left,

142
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:03,625
I have my starting lattice where I have high clustering and high diameter.

143
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:06,430
On the- when I have p equals 1,

144
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,674
when all the edges are rewired,

145
00:07:08,674 --> 00:07:11,300
then I have a G_np random graph model.

146
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,999
I have low clustering and low diameter.

147
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:18,650
And what turns out is that for some intermediate values of p,

148
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,495
I- I retain both.

149
00:07:20,495 --> 00:07:24,740
I have enough shortcuts so that enough edges rewire.

150
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,485
So the diameter is small.

151
00:07:26,485 --> 00:07:29,205
And I still have a lot of, uh,

152
00:07:29,205 --> 00:07:33,925
these original edges present so that the clustering, uh, is high.

153
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:39,200
So basically this rewiring mechanism allows us to interpolate between, uh, the, um,

154
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,530
uh, high clustering, the regular network,

155
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,690
and the, uh, random graph.

156
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:48,920
And if we create a plot of the following where on the x-axis,

157
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,930
we create the rewiring probability,

158
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,750
and then on one side of the axis we- we

159
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,825
plot the clustering coefficient here in dashed line,

160
00:07:56,825 --> 00:08:00,560
and on the other axis we plot average shortest path length.

161
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,450
And notice how clustering coefficient remains high even as

162
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:10,505
the- as the probability of rewiring increases and only then starts to decrease.

163
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:15,410
But the shortest path length drops very quickly as I keep increasing, uh,

164
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:19,535
the rewiring probability p. So it means that there is this range of

165
00:08:19,535 --> 00:08:23,810
p where I have high clustering but low shortest path length.

166
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,150
And this is what we call the small-world, right?

167
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:32,225
It's- it's a network that is heavily clustered but still has short, uh, shortest paths.

168
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:35,315
So to summarize the small-world model,

169
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:38,470
um, you know, could we have a network with high clustering?

170
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,419
Uh, and the same time,

171
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,079
uh, be a small-world,

172
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,715
meaning have small diameter?

173
00:08:43,715 --> 00:08:45,875
And, uh, the answer is yes.

174
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,050
And you know why?

175
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:52,670
Because you don't need more than just a few random links to bring the diameter down.

176
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,380
So basically the diameter,

177
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,090
the shortest path lengths are

178
00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:00,395
much less robust property than the clustering coefficient, right?

179
00:09:00,395 --> 00:09:03,200
For- to have a low clustering coefficient,

180
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,495
you need a lot of edges in triangles,

181
00:09:05,495 --> 00:09:07,160
but to have low diameter,

182
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,180
you just need a couple of random shortcuts along distant parts

183
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:15,505
of the network and that will collapse the diameter very- very quickly.

184
00:09:15,505 --> 00:09:19,390
So, um, what's the significance of the small-world model?

185
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:25,460
It provides insights into the interplay between the clustering and small diameter.

186
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,915
It captures the structure of, uh,

187
00:09:27,915 --> 00:09:30,420
many, uh, real-world networks.

188
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,335
Uh, and it accounts for high clustering in- in those networks,

189
00:09:34,335 --> 00:09:36,780
um, but what is still missing is,

190
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,490
uh, the degree distribution, right?

191
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,350
The- the- in- in- how- the way we defined the small-world model,

192
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,175
uh, all the nodes have the same degree.

193
00:09:44,175 --> 00:09:45,340
You know, in our case,

194
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,460
I think all the nodes had degree 4 which each- which

195
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,735
is kind of unrealistic as we saw from the messenger network.

196
00:09:51,735 --> 00:09:56,560
But just, um, basically through these two models that they have presented,

197
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,100
I wanted to show you how really you can- you can think of this

198
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,785
as a- as a way to explain formation of networks.

199
00:10:03,785 --> 00:10:06,270
And you can think of it as a way to,

200
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,065
um, capture different properties of the network.

201
00:10:09,065 --> 00:10:14,330
And think about what kind of processes might be happening in the real world,

202
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:19,670
in, you know, in our everyday social networks that give rise to the networks.

203
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:24,030
Uh, with properties that we actually observe, uh, in real life.
