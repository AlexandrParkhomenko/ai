1
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:16,699
So, let's get started. Welcome to cs372. Like
i mentioned last time, we got into the final

2
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:23,340
lecture series on "Consciousness and Mind."
The first lecture was given by Dr. Duvvuri

3
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:30,641
because we really want a psychiatrist to come
in to tell us the real-world situations. Something

4
00:00:30,641 --> 00:00:36,870
is normal and something, e.g., mentally disorder,
is abnormal (or atypical, deviant, or unhealthy).

5
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,230
You know psychiatrists when they try to diagnose
whether someone has mental disorders they

6
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:46,310
definitely compare normal behaviors with the
abnormal behaviors. (As we will illustrate,

7
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:54,440
finding order or disorder by comparing the
two.) Let me project the slides first.

8
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:06,860
Okay, so today's lecture we will be focusing
on consciousness: how to model consciousness.

9
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:15,069
As I mentioned last time there are several
topics we need to cover and started with a

10
00:01:15,069 --> 00:01:22,880
comparison between normal and abnormal behaviors.
Today we focus on "what is consciousness"

11
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:29,060
and next time will be "where is consciousness"
and then how it works. And finally we will

12
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:36,799
address mind and ethics, which at this point
you may consider to be a little bit abstract.

13
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,679
But once we lay out the foundation of "what
is consciousness" and "where it is", maybe

14
00:01:42,679 --> 00:01:50,719
mind and ethics can be more evident. And we
even attempt to quantify them (ethics and

15
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:59,169
love). Let's look at why we want to study
the topic. It all started about two and a

16
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:06,319
half years ago, when Yoshua Bengio at the
Neurips conference, he gave a keynote on the

17
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:13,500
limitations of the current AI. In the talk,
basically we all understand the limitations

18
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:21,290
today, AI today requires large volume of training
data, and lacking robustness. If you're just

19
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:31,150
changing a few pixels, classification could
be erroneous. We have problems with explainability,

20
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:39,250
reasoning, and causal analysis. We all understand
we have generalization problems. Bengio mentioned

21
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:46,640
there are two avenues to address the issues.
One is that we develop some bandaids to try

22
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:54,470
to patch so-called system one today. And then
the second approach is let's start from afresh,

23
00:02:54,470 --> 00:03:03,430
start from scratch, start from high level
cognition. There are two philosophical thinkings.

24
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:11,120
One is consciousness, or they call system
two. Is consciousness purely computational

25
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,180
just like system one? I will get into slightly
details about why we think unconsciousness,

26
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:26,630
the processing, is only computation, and consciousness
may be computation only or may be beyond computation.

27
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:35,790
Bengio's idea was computation all the way.
If you talk to other scholars, their thoughts

28
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:43,260
like Roger Penrose's, he would say no because
consciousness and unconsciousness, their mechanisms

29
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:52,100
are different. Some "matters" may not be purely
computational. It's interesting when i came

30
00:03:52,100 --> 00:04:00,500
across the book published by Erwin Schrodinger
in 1944. This is a very very long time ago.

31
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:10,540
Erwin is the grandfather or the father of
quantum mechanics. In his book even almost

32
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:19,470
80 years ago he actually depicted the idea
of consciousness. I think his book is interesting

33
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:28,550
because he doesn't talk about philosophy or
theology. He really focuses on physics, using

34
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:35,419
physics to explain consciousness. So you see
some science there rather than just abstract

35
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:43,629
thinking and debating. In bengio's talk, he
mentioned a book published by Daniel Kahneman.

36
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:49,364
The title of book is "Thinking Fast and Thinking
Slow". System one at the bottom (of the slide)

37
00:04:49,364 --> 00:04:58,510
is the current AI. Daniel characterizes the
current AI to be thinking fast, thinking habitually,

38
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:05,550
intuitively, and unconsciously. And we cannot
explain the mechanisms or causality. System

39
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:12,999
two, on the other hand, is thinking slow.
We think logically, sequentially. We plan

40
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:18,169
and we conduct reasoning.

41
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:24,030
Mapping thinking fast and thinking slow or
system one and system two to psychological

42
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:32,449
study, we look at the father of psychology
Sigmund Freud. His view of human mind has

43
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:39,819
two parts. At the bottom we consider to be
unconsciousness. Let us blow up the figure

44
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:48,050
on the right hand side. Unconsciousness, according
to Freud, there are fears, violent motives,

45
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:54,080
unacceptable sexual desires, irrational wishes,
and so on so forth. And consciousness includes

46
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,169
thoughts and perceptions. This is really in
the early days, and Freud came up with this

47
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:06,720
kind of classification. It's interesting to
me, in unconscious level Freud put down a

48
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:16,499
few very negative adjectives. For instance,
before wish Freud put irrational, and urges

49
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:27,610
immoral, right. Or needs, and you put selfish
in front of it. But our needs: we have urge,

50
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:35,410
perhaps we are really hungry or we get some
external stimuli, and we we feel hurt. You

51
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:42,949
couldn't actually put a moral value in front
of those needs. Moral judgment should be probably

52
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:49,599
in the consciousness level. So let's don't
judge morality at this point until the last

53
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:57,270
lecture. Basically a lot of functions of human
being work in the unconscious state. One evident

54
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:02,940
example is our breathing. We don't have to
pay attention to our breathing and we don't

55
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:11,550
have to be conscious about our heartbeat.
Everything is done virtually automatically.

56
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:18,839
Let's define what is consciousness. This is
a very challenging topic and you get perspectives

57
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:24,930
from different disciplines including physicists,
biologists, neuroscientists, theologians,

58
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:32,909
philosophers, computer scientists, and so
on so forth. There have been over 20,000 papers

59
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:39,759
published so far but producing little results.
Let's come back to consciousness. Let's look

60
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:47,559
at some a prominent definitions. The first
definition was given by Michio Kaku. He is

61
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:54,839
a very famous physicist and he said well,
consciousness can be defined in relation to

62
00:07:54,839 --> 00:08:01,129
the space. To us, if we want to be conscious
about our presence, yes we have the the sense

63
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:11,789
of space, and we also have the sense of time.
Time is critical because if we want to derive

64
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:19,460
some thoughts, we need to probably look into
the past so we have to tap into the memory.

65
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:25,419
We want to do planning, we want to be able
to project into the future. So space and time,

66
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:33,760
we accept those are critical foundations of
consciousness. And also in relationship to

67
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:43,510
others. Let's give some examples. These are
the examples given by Kaku. Though it's debatable

68
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:51,250
whether plants have consciousness or not,
Kaku basically saying if you look at consciousness,

69
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:59,800
which can be quantified by the number of feedback
loops. Any organisms have feedback loops and

70
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:06,510
can enhance their livings, you can probably
just consider that (they have) consciousness.

71
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:13,530
For plants, plants can sense temperature and
can sense where the water is. So the roots

72
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:21,360
of the plant would grow toward or grow toward
the direction of water. There are many flowers

73
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:31,880
would grow toward the sun, or toward the high
temperature direction. If you look at our

74
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:38,190
pets, these are mammals, typically. They would
react to threats and they have interactions

75
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:46,990
with human and other animals. For human beings,
we have a lot of sensors or feedback loops.

76
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:53,310
We do learning and like for example learning
i think teacher will provide feedback. We

77
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:59,390
have emotion. Emotion reacts to other people
and other people would also provide us feedback.

78
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:03,240
We have constantly been evaluated in this
society.

79
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:10,320
Next, consciousness versus attention. These
are two different terms. Attention has already

80
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:17,630
been studied thoroughly by psychiatrists.
Also in computer science you know our "attention

81
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:25,790
model" using the term attention. But strictly
speaking these are two different ideas and

82
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:33,430
two different terms. It's possible or it's
actually kind of consciousness and attention

83
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:40,910
they are entangled with each other. But they
are distinct in the brain functionality. We

84
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:47,990
generally we can treat consciousness as a
synthesizer or a summarizer. Consciousness,

85
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:54,360
would kind of summarize the entire environment
using different sensors. For instance, sitting

86
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:00,820
in the classroom we use our visual (eyes),
ears, we use our different organs to sense

87
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:08,150
the entire environment. But analyzer is done
by the attention module. Attention module,

88
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:14,280
for example I look at the entire classroom,
then i want to talk to Bill. I pay my attention

89
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:19,930
to one individual and this is because I already
know the entire contextual information. When

90
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:28,450
I want to zoom into a specific individual
i'm doing the attention, more focused. So

91
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:36,180
you could say consciousness may operate in
a longer time scale including information

92
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:43,280
summary, planning, decision making. Attention
is to select the information to meet the current

93
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,684
behavior objective. So, one is longer term
and one is shorter term.

94
00:11:48,684 --> 00:11:56,590
Let's look at one example used by psychiatrists.
If we look at the screen right now we see

95
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:06,890
some symbols here. For the bottom-up consciousness,
basically we are sensing the pixels our eyes,

96
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:13,130
retina, sensing these pixels and there's an
image perception in our brain. Consciously

97
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:20,690
we're trying to detect or try to recognize
this symbol. How many people consider this

98
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:32,440
is a digit,
two digits, or an alphabet? B, 13, and B,

99
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:39,000
is ambiguous, right? Let's say if you have
these three characters in a row. This is called

100
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,840
top-down attention. You are consciously aware
of several characters here. Then when you

101
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:54,130
zoom in to pay attention to the middle character,
you tend to say this is a B. If you have another

102
00:12:54,130 --> 00:13:03,240
sequence of numbers and here you would probably
say 13. So top-down attention works differently

103
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:09,470
from bottom-up attention. In the end of this
lecture i would go back to talk about the

104
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:15,390
current machine learning model, the attention
model. The attention model, the current implementation

105
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:22,651
is pretty much bottom-up not top-down. Do
we need to have top-down attention built into

106
00:13:22,651 --> 00:13:29,340
machine learning? My answer is absolutely
yes. So this is a really interesting opportunity.

107
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:36,430
When we talk about system one system two integration
this is an opportunity to enhance system two.

108
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:43,850
We can model subjectivity into AI, right?
Subjectivity, let's do a very simple discussion.

109
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:51,010
Two different people look at the same instance
of object, they may have different feelings.

110
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:58,910
But when you say objectively, when a machine
perceives an object, the machine can only

111
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:06,480
come up with one classification. Otherwise
it's a bug. Otherwise we say it's an error.

112
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,870
So, subjectivity has to be top down. Where
is this top? If you say objectivity, then

113
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:21,690
bottom up would be sufficient. Discussion
one. Is it possible that consciousness is

114
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:36,290
absent of attention. We are in a conscious
state but there's no attention whatsoever.

115
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:40,290
Pretty much i have already given the answer.
But it's still debatable, I mean if you look

116
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:45,560
at articles in psychiatry about what's the
difference between consciousness and attention,

117
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:52,930
they've done lots of experiments and looking
at the brain activities under different situations.

118
00:14:52,930 --> 00:15:01,320
They're still not conclusive. But in principle
people agree the top-down attention mechanism

119
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:10,550
needs to be in consciousness state. But the
bottom-up is debatable because if you talk

120
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:16,980
to psychiatrists they have different ideas.
But if i read into Schrodinger's model and

121
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:23,860
which i will show in the next slide. The question
is when do we transition from unconscious

122
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:32,730
state to conscious state. When you ride your
bike today or take Margherita to the campus

123
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:39,960
today are you consciously... are you always
in conscious mode when you ride your bike?

124
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,870
You say i'm balancing on the bike. When we
learned how to

125
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:50,270
bike, do you see kids learn how to walk? They
are constantly in the consciousness state:

126
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:56,460
They want to balance themselves they don't
want to fall. But i don't think most of us

127
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:04,400
walking on the campus today, we we are very
conscious about balancing our body, right?

128
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:12,540
We are walking in pretty much in unconscious
state. In the biking situation, I saw my neighbors,

129
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:20,279
because i live in front of Palo Alto high
school, and quite a few students biking at

130
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:26,160
the same time watching on their phones. Definitely
they are not paying any attention, not probably

131
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:33,040
not even in the conscious state when they
are biking. The notion of biking, it's already

132
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,130
kind of in unconscious state because it's
already

133
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:39,790
habitual. Let's look at how they (consciousness
and unconsciousness) transition to each other,

134
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:46,840
so we may be able to understand some insights.
According to schrodinger,

135
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:54,000
if we are in unconsciousness state, to get
into consciousness state, there must be a

136
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:02,850
quantum jump, quantum jump a quantum mechanism
phenomenon. Quantum jump means there are

137
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:10,069
two different states of an atom, and it wants
to transition from one state the second one

138
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,069
(on the slide, points 1 and 2),

139
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:17,599
there must be the energy surge (point 3).
Once you have energy surge to a certain level,

140
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,249
then there's a
probability that quantum jump or state transition

141
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:29,161
will happen. Likewise here, Schrodinger saying
if a person is in unconsciousness state. Let's

142
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:36,530
say we continue sensing the environment. Our
body is sensing the temperature but in the

143
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:43,790
beginning we don't feel anything different.
But accumulatively and we started to feel

144
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:50,640
very warm and getting hotter and hotter. And
then suddenly there's a quantum jump and we

145
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:58,220
start to feel if there's some kind of heat
or cold. Now the feeling of heat or feeling

146
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:03,280
of cold really gets into the consciousness
state.

147
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,540
But there's another situation which would
look at some scenarios in the next slide.

148
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:15,760
Look at the left-hand side. Sensitization
typically is classified to act in unconscious

149
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,620
state. Like acrophobia, i don't know, i do
have

150
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:26,940
fear of heights and when i walk on like Chicago's
Wills Tower...

151
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:32,460
In this tall building, there's an observatory.
You walk out there's a piece of glass under

152
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:38,800
your feet. And i just couldn't stand up! You
asked me whether i'm consciously fear about

153
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:44,820
height or unconsciously fear about height?
I have to say I cannot control myself. So

154
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:50,040
that's considered to be a phobia and considered
to be in unconsciousness state. A lot of people

155
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:55,520
have phobia about noise about something they
don't like like my one of my daughters phobia

156
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:07,309
with spiders. The second one is habituation---
something going on for a long long time, and

157
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:14,290
something repetitive going on. One example
is sensing, and sensing if there is no sufficient

158
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:21,431
energy to incur a state transition, it just
continues to to be done in the unconscious

159
00:19:21,431 --> 00:19:22,431
state.

160
00:19:22,431 --> 00:19:29,820
Like right now i'm watching this entire classroom
and if i don't pay attention to anything.

161
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:39,360
Do you think i can sense the water fountain
outside? outside the windows? Actually i could!

162
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:46,030
Water fountain is out there. Unless i pay
attention to matters outside the window it's

163
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:53,650
in my sensing in the domain of my sensing
but it's in unconsciousness state.

164
00:19:53,650 --> 00:20:01,790
Our organ operations---breathing, heartbeat---
there's no way we can control them. They just

165
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:06,210
function so called "normally", and we pay
attention to them only when our breathing

166
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:13,190
gets into trouble or our heartbeats get into
trouble. Metabolism right? You don't care,

167
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:18,480
you don't actually pay attention to how you
digest the food and how the nutrition get

168
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:26,710
distributed into blood vessels. This figure
here shows there are two dimensions: in the

169
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:31,941
x axis is computational complexity. On the
left-hand side computational complexity is

170
00:20:31,941 --> 00:20:36,710
very low, on the right-hand side computation
requirement is very high. In the vertical

171
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:43,151
axis, we show on the top is consciousness
and at the bottom is unconsciousness. The

172
00:20:43,151 --> 00:20:54,610
first question here is "1 + 7", we probably
consider this to be computational non-intensive,

173
00:20:54,610 --> 00:21:04,090
and pi square, it's more complex. To us, 1
+ 7 we can do it in seconds but pi square

174
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:10,950
requires us to work on this arithmetic for
really some time. Actually pi squared does

175
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:20,090
not have an answer! Pi it's a huge number
(infinite decimal). We do arithmetic in unconsciousness

176
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:25,760
state or consciousness state?
Even computationally it can be very simple,

177
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:32,140
right? 1 + 7 is very simple, we have to do
it in the consciousness state. This is probably

178
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:42,059
an easy example. Do you have a disagreement?

179
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:53,390
Let's now look at more challenging situations.
I'm going to show uh different applications

180
00:21:53,390 --> 00:22:00,309
and let's try to put them in the right place.
The first is let's play Go, not playing with

181
00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:05,300
computers just people playing go. Where should
we place

182
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:12,110
this kind of chess playing, or Go game?

183
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:20,720
Should it be computationally intensive? or
it's trivial? or it's in conscious state?

184
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,390
or we can play the game in unconscious state?

185
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:45,090
Computationally high? okay. Conscious, right?
We cannot just sleep and play chess. The second

186
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:56,920
question is vision, our vision, is it conscious
state or unconscious?

187
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:11,990
Student: both. Instructor: Yes good point.
sensing can be in unconscious state but when

188
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:18,160
we have feeling when we try to pay attention
to certain things then we get into a consciousness

189
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,210
state. that's good.

190
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:27,830
And AlphaGo, what do you think? AlphaGo is
for sure computationally intensive, when the

191
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:35,350
training was being performed. But if AlphaGo
has already recorded all the possible moves,

192
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:41,090
during playing with an individual. That individual
is really in a hustling state---

193
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:48,540
consciousness and high computation complex---thinking
very very slow, and try to project all the

194
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:53,570
possible moves in the future. But how about
alpha go in a playing mode? not in a training

195
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:59,110
mode. Do you think the computational complexity
is extremely high?

196
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:06,020
And do you think it's in the consciousness
state to play with human? We know machine

197
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:11,990
may not have consciousness, right? AlphaGo
in the playing mode it's in unconsciousness

198
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:22,590
state and what it's doing is doing search.
Seeing the current layout of the board, and

199
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:27,850
because it already tried itself to see all
possible moves, so it said, oh, this is the

200
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:34,520
current board configuration. Let me search
the best move given this particular configuration.

201
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:43,220
That's just a search kind of method.
We can consider this search, compared with

202
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:51,290
the training process, it's much less computational
intensive. Let's plot these four (applications)

203
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,300
inon the diagram.

204
00:24:52,300 --> 00:25:00,200
AlphaGo, i would say it's at the bottom (unconsciousness).
Computationally high? i kind of question that,

205
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,660
we can move it to the left a little bit. And
vision is in between and getting into preconscious

206
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:12,190
state. And nature language processing for
sure, we talk about when we have language

207
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:18,510
to have conversation with each other, we have
to get into consciousness state.

208
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:24,140
Of course if we just look at alphabets, we
probably in unconscious state. But eventually

209
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:29,000
when we formulate an article, a conversation
with others, we get into the consciousness

210
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:38,200
state. These are just some examples. Now we
look at Schrodinger's point of view. A look

211
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:46,921
at consciousness in relation to learning and
adaptation. He's looking from the evolution

212
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:56,820
perspective, and more specifically, he uses
physics to try to explain these two modes.

213
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:04,030
The first one is the second law of thermodynamics,
the second we already mentioned, quantum mechanics,

214
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:11,730
that is, quantum jump. Finally he mentioned
the relationship with mortality.

215
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:21,730
Mortality we will talk about in the last lecture.
Humans select to learn so when we want to

216
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:32,320
learn something we learn for two purposes.
We learn for wants or we learn for needs.

217
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:39,929
Needs are basic survival requirements like
eating, cooking, those are you can consider

218
00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:47,350
to be needs. Or we want to find water, we
want to learn how to dig a well, and those

219
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:56,520
are for needs, not optional. And for needs
we talk about in the bottom (of the slide)---survival

220
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:06,380
or adaptation. Human must learn to survive.
If we have a drought condition here in Santa

221
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:12,309
Clara, we probably would go to supermarket
to buy drinking water or we go to other states

222
00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:17,590
to find water. We have to be able to adapt
to survive. However, there are certain essential

223
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:23,700
skills we don't have to learn at all. In fact
we cannot learn, we cannot afford learning,

224
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,610
and we don't know how to learn them! We don't
have time to learn them. Just give you two

225
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:37,280
examples---breathing and heartbeat.
(An) embryo can already start having heartbeats.

226
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:43,559
Do you think embryo learns how to do heartbeats?
No. Embryo doesn't have consciousness (to

227
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:47,410
learn).
It's interesting the complex operations of

228
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:54,610
human beings were already given before we
were born. We did not have to learn them and

229
00:27:54,610 --> 00:28:00,491
actually we couldn't learn them. Can you learn
how to breathe differently or changing your

230
00:28:00,491 --> 00:28:08,480
heartbeat rhythms consciously? The answer
is no, not really. Philosophically you'll

231
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:20,010
say oh most challenging matters already been
given by someone or evolution. Only the not

232
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:27,570
so important things, I say, wants your desire.
I want to have something better to eat, I

233
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:33,850
want to swim, I want to bike. If you (we)
don't don't bike you can still survive. You

234
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:39,600
can walk to the classroom maybe get more healthier.

235
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:50,070
For the optional things, yes, we can learn.
But for the essential matters, we cannot learn.

236
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:55,970
We don't have time to learn, and they are
embedded in our our body. I actually, when

237
00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:04,250
i translated Schrodinger's "What is Life",
 my own feeling at the end was saying: well,

238
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:12,281
what we could learn in the world is really
really limited. First of all essential skills

239
00:29:12,281 --> 00:29:19,630
already be given, right. Secondly when we
were born we are confined by our heredity.

240
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:26,140
Heredity includes broadly not only our chromosome
DNA, but also includes

241
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:40,330
our identity. Our DNA gave us our IQ, maybe
mortality means diseases, and EQ, personality.

242
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:49,530
We also we were born with identity: nationality,
family. Nationality and family already give

243
00:29:49,530 --> 00:30:00,410
us some intrinsic directions, inertials. Nationality
already gives you a set of hates. Your family

244
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:07,660
may already give you a set of possible religions
you would you would try to convert into so

245
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:14,400
you don't really have a lot of choices. Yes,
some people are more rebellious, and they

246
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:20,970
can defy their identities. But most of people
would just be conformative.

247
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:29,120
Therefore, what we could learn mostly is for
our wants, and they are optional, they are

248
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:36,510
extra-curriculum. I was joking about the the
free will we have? Probably just for

249
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:47,480
ordering dishes, on doorDash or in a restaurant.
Other things pretty much restricted. Okay

250
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
free will...

251
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:54,350
when we go to lecture #18 (#17). Free will
is it's kind of a philosophical question.

252
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:59,410
Do we really have free will? It's just a survey
for the fun of it.

253
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:04,100
How many consider you have free will? (~50%
of the class)

254
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:09,230
How many consider you don't have free will
whatsoever? (zero vote)

255
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:20,030
Okay. Lex Fridman, an MIT professor, who has
produced many podcasts. So far i think he

256
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:27,210
has gotten about 270 episodes. In the early
days the podcast each episode is about one

257
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:33,450
hour. And started about Eps#200, there's no
limit of time. There are podcasts lasting

258
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:39,920
even four or five hours. It's really really
intriguing, some subjects, The two questions

259
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:45,000
he always asked, to most of the guest speakers
he

260
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,010
would ask... The first question is

261
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:53,531
"Are you a robot? Then, "Do you really think
human

262
00:31:53,531 --> 00:31:58,309
has free will?" "Do you have free will or
not?" "Everything is predetermined or not?"

263
00:31:58,309 --> 00:32:05,190
Surprisingly those smart people he interviewed
including Nobel laureates, Turing Award winners.

264
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:09,300
Their answers are pretty coherent.

265
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:23,050
Most of people like including myself, I consider
I'm a robot. Free will is my illusion.

266
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:28,880
Let's come back (laughing) to the lecture.
Human, how do we learn? We learn starting

267
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:36,000
from we have a need to learn, then starts
from external stimulus. Suppose here we're

268
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,860
just using "vision" as an example. Our retinas
start

269
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:48,010
sensing pixels (light) and then our perception,
our sensing circuits will convert input signals

270
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:55,120
into
quantifiable, we call sensual quality. In

271
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:02,160
vision, sensing we sensing a lot of pixels
into our eyes, those like electrical signals,

272
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:08,799
then the sensual quality is kind of color.
It's a it's a vital one. Then you could say

273
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:14,250
texture and shape.
Eventually we have understanding we recognize

274
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:20,480
objects, and object recognition requires our
memory at the same time. Let's just look at

275
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:29,809
the first stage of sensing. We have 1) sensing
the signals and then 2) central quality. Do

276
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:37,970
we get identical sensual quality. Here again
we may only be in unconsciousness state right?

277
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:44,900
The picture on the top.
Let's blow up the picture. it's only sensing

278
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:53,720
and producing sensual quality, and then get
into our either cerebrum or cerebellum, either

279
00:33:53,720 --> 00:34:00,360
processing consciously or unconsciously. Finally
we have responses. This is process of learning.

280
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:10,159
In just the sensing mode, do we have...
is it a one-to-one relationship: do we have

281
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:17,510
one signal producing one sensual quality or
there could be a mixture of multiple signals

282
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:23,679
can produce one sensual quality? And one (input)
signal can produce multiple different sensual

283
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,290
qualities?

284
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:32,210
Very simple question is: when we perceive
sensual quality to be yellow, yellow color.

285
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:39,859
What should be the input to our retinas?
If we look at the light spectrum, when we

286
00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:48,690
have this 600 nanometer signal and it peaks
in our eyes as yellow color. This is given

287
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:55,060
by schrodinger and now it's well known. The
same sensual quality can come from different

288
00:34:55,060 --> 00:35:00,890
mixtures of signals.
If we have two other signals 535 which is

289
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:09,950
green and plus 760 which is red, the combine
of the two also gives us yellow sensation.

290
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:15,560
Here we have possibility of multiple signals
combinations, different mixtures, can give

291
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:22,182
us the same sensation or sensual quality.
Then we have to think about computers, how a

292
00:35:22,182 --> 00:35:28,680
computer operates? can compute function under
this situation? Different inputs have different

293
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:36,450
outputs, i think computer could do that, right?
Function can handle many to one mapping.

294
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:44,950
But the problem is the other way. The other
way is same color (light), but different sensual

295
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:48,850
qualities in different individuals.

296
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:58,770
It's very evident for people having colorblind,
their essential quality is different even

297
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:04,710
we are perceiving the same thing. They have
red-green color blind blue-yellow and also

298
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:10,360
complete color blind. Let's look at one example
of red-green color blind. On the left-hand

299
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:16,920
(of the slide) side there's no colorblind;
on the right-hand side this person has a red-green

300
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,920
color blind,

301
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,750
and how the person perceived. Here is already
interesting this is a good picture produced

302
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:30,480
by psychiatrists, but how can psychiatrists
figure out like---how can I figure out your

303
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:39,349
color quality? When we look at this picture
on the left hand side, i myself see yellow,

304
00:36:39,349 --> 00:36:46,030
green, and the red, and maybe other colors.
You may also see the same colors or you may

305
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,030
not.

306
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:52,570
For color blind, they only see green. But
suppose we don't have colorblind. Even the

307
00:36:52,570 --> 00:37:01,550
same red for us, the sensation in our retinas
may be different. your ReD is probably different

308
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:08,630
from my REd. This is already to us it's very
challenging to compute it's also very challenging

309
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:14,300
because you have different inputs, we all
consider to be the same. And here even we

310
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:22,280
have different color qualities, still people
can recognize there are different fruits,

311
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:26,820
apples, and pineapple, and so on so forth.

312
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:34,960
Now let's review two math concepts the first
one is relation. Relation defines as a relationship

313
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:42,660
between two values. We have four different
relations on this slide: one too many, one

314
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:50,750
to one, many to one, and many too many. However,
function is a relation where each input has

315
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:58,811
only one output. Among the four relations,
only the two in the middle: one to one, and

316
00:37:58,811 --> 00:38:06,390
many to one, (each) produces one output. They
are legitimate functions. Now let's go back

317
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:16,110
to visit our visual system. We have input
as senses and input generates sensual qualities.

318
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:25,410
As we already mentioned using colorblind as
an example, here we have one to many relationship.

319
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:32,880
Then from the sensual quality, let's say you
and I both look at the ocean, and we may have

320
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:41,570
different emotions incurred, because maybe
our memory or our computational information.

321
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:49,420
Therefore, we encounter this interesting problem
of from senses to sensual quality is not a

322
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:56,540
function, and from sensual quality to emotion
is not a function either.

323
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:06,060
But in our CNN or machine learning algorithms,
we typically implement everything as a function.

324
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:13,910
Therefore the interesting challenge to us
is how can we model one to many?

325
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:21,220
When we consider contextual information in
memory, and this we call subjectivity... Now

326
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:27,970
let's pop up one level. Let's revisit our
stimulus-response pathway. We already talked

327
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:37,970
about input generating sensing quality. Before
human can produce a response, our brain will

328
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:46,540
be operating on the signals and making a decision.
Our brain operates in two different modes,

329
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:53,420
consciousness and unconsciousness. When we
define consciousness in the beginning of the

330
00:39:53,420 --> 00:40:03,349
lecture, we try to contrast the term consciousness
with attention. Attention can be either bottom-up

331
00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:04,890
as shown on the left hand side

332
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:12,930
of this diagram or top-down. When attention
is top-down, it's pretty much goal driven

333
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:22,410
and it operates in the consciousness mode.
However, when attention is bottom-up, it's

334
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:32,500
a stimulus driven. We continue sensing our
world, and when the collected energy reaches

335
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:38,770
a certain threshold, then there's a transition
going on from unconsciousness to consciousness.

336
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:49,050
I really appreciate the explanation done by
Erwin Schrodinger, the father of quantum mechanics.

337
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:55,670
Let's take a look at how a CNN neuron works.
A neuron collects information from upstream

338
00:40:55,670 --> 00:41:03,609
neurons. When the energy level reaches a threshold,
the neuron will fire, and would propagate

339
00:41:03,609 --> 00:41:10,960
the signal to the downstream neurons. This
is precisely how Schrodinger explains the

340
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,680
state transition in an atom. An atom can be
in two different modes

341
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:25,150
---on this slide mode 1 and mode 2. An atom is
in the stable state until the energy level

342
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:31,330
reaches 3. Once the energy level reaches a
threshold,

343
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:37,740
there's a probability that a state transition
will happen. This is exactly the ingenious

344
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,900
of the CNN model,

345
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:49,020
which models exactly how schrodinger depicts
the state transition physically in the atoms.

346
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:57,710
How about the other way? How do we transition
from the consciousness state to unconscious

347
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:58,710
state?

348
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:06,490
When we listen to music, in the beginning
we may be paying attention to the lyric, but

349
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:14,590
eventually, or in my case, i would fall into
sleep. Driving is another experience. If I'm

350
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:21,300
very familiar with the route, I do
not really pay attention to the details. The

351
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:30,200
emotion or emotion of sadness or happiness
eventually will fade away. And these are all

352
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:37,480
good things because in the emotion scenario
we don't want to be sad forever. Evolution

353
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:44,500
builds in, in our brain we will forget about
the sadness, and at the same time, we cannot

354
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:51,530
be happy forever we have to transition into
the normal mode and to continue to live with

355
00:42:51,530 --> 00:43:01,630
our lives. Schrodinger saying well the transition
is kind of fading away can be thought as second

356
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:06,010
law of thermodynamics.

357
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:12,550
The second law of thermodynamics expresses
the fundamental and the simple truth about

358
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:23,090
the universe that disorder characterized by
a quantity called entropy, always increases.

359
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:30,339
When the entropy is peaked, the
isolated system is we call in the dead state

360
00:43:30,339 --> 00:43:40,410
or inert state. And like our physical body,
eventually aging is a phenomenon of the second

361
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:48,859
law of thermodynamics. Schrodinger in his
book actually made a joke about how can we

362
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:55,210
live longer by slowing down our increase of
disorder.

363
00:43:55,210 --> 00:44:01,710
There he suggested a couple of remedies. If
you are interested (in living longer) we can

364
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:07,500
talk about it offline.
The second law may be formulated by the observation

365
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:15,780
that the entropy is in the isolated system
left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease

366
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:23,420
as this system always arrives at the state
of thermodynamic equilibrium where the entropy

367
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:33,210
is the highest. There are several experiments
and which can illustrate how this second law

368
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:39,349
works.
A popular one is in a closed space you inject

369
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:47,930
some color particles, and eventually the color
particles will be distributed evenly in the

370
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:54,541
close space. Or maybe you input two different
kind of air one in green color the other one

371
00:44:54,541 --> 00:45:03,510
in red color and after a period of time those
two colors will mix together.

372
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:12,290
Now we put everything together and we start
with the in this consciousness state we learn

373
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:18,230
how to walk how to bike and the first time
come to stanford we have to navigate using

374
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:27,000
a map and so on so forth. Once we get familiar
with walking, biking, and driving directions,

375
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,869
we get into a habitual and repetitive mode.
Then there's the transition happens

376
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:40,260
---when we continue doing these tasks we will
be operating most of these tasks in unconsciousness

377
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:47,109
mode. As we mentioned this is really good
for the human being and for animals because

378
00:45:47,109 --> 00:45:55,670
our emotions, we like them to fade away so
we can get on with our lives. In the unconscious

379
00:45:55,670 --> 00:46:04,070
mode, see here we do a lot of tasks including
our heartbeats, metabolism unconsciously.

380
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:10,910
But if we drive to the campus and suddenly
we see an unexpected pediatric pedestrian

381
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:16,330
we are suddenly transitioning back to the
conscious mode to try to figure out how to

382
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:24,800
handle that situation. If you bike you hit
a tree suddenly, yes we need to stop there

383
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:30,031
and transition into the conscious mode and
handle the abruptive situation. This (process)

384
00:46:30,031 --> 00:46:38,870
is called adaptation, which is necessary for
survival. Okay, let's now make some observations.

385
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:47,109
In consciousness and unconsciousness and when
they need to transition, they transition via

386
00:46:47,109 --> 00:46:54,881
two physics mechanisms---quantum jump and
the second law of thermal dynamics. These

387
00:46:54,881 --> 00:47:04,000
are great because we have a solid foundation
to implement the transitions. We're learning

388
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:12,390
for adaptation is done in the consciousness
mode and mainly for our biological needs and

389
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:20,490
for our our wants, which could be optional.
We eventually fade emotion into unconscious

390
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:29,380
state when things are repetitive. We also
talk about in the conscious state and when

391
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:39,089
we pay attention it could be top-down attention,
because we are aware of the bigger picture

392
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:49,060
then we want to focus on some specifics. In
attention or in a conscious mode one important

393
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:56,410
element is we cannot model this as just a
function because there could be one too many

394
00:47:56,410 --> 00:48:03,460
mapping, which means that one sensing quality
can map to different emotions. And this we

395
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:09,530
call subjectivity a machine does not have
subjectivity if you look at today's machine

396
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:16,010
learning to this machine learning is the results
average of subjectivity. The training data

397
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:21,369
may be labeled by different people, they have
their own subjectivities. And we aggregate

398
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:29,270
everything together and uniformly or universally
we learn a set of parameters and then perform

399
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:38,641
prediction. How can we model subjectivity?
This, we can talk about it shortly after these

400
00:48:38,641 --> 00:48:46,700
observations. We, one way to do it to avoid
this function definition issue is we can take

401
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:54,060
more arguments. If we take space, time, and
value into the arguments of a function, then

402
00:48:54,060 --> 00:49:00,060
there's the possibility that we could have
a one-to-one mapping. Bottom-up attention

403
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:06,839
is performed in the unconsciousness mode.
So we can only pay attention to one or two

404
00:49:06,839 --> 00:49:13,920
things and at the same time there are many
things going on in the environment and our

405
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:20,680
sense organs continuously sensing the environment
or heart continue to beat until something

406
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:26,900
unusual happens, which will trigger a high
energy then a transition will be made into

407
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:38,250
the conscious mode. But when quantum jump
performs prematurely, it means the threshold

408
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:50,250
is abnormally low, like Dr Duvvuri introduced
mental disorders on Monday's lecture for phobia.

409
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:58,600
Let's say acrophobia the fear of heights got
triggered at a much lower threshold. This

410
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:08,070
must be treated. At this moment the patient
can only be treated, targeting symptoms. But

411
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:13,620
in the future, hopefully we can get down to
the source. And this is precisely what the

412
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:22,420
next lecture will cover ---where is consciousness.
Let's defer the discussion to next Monday.

413
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:31,550
In closing the first half of the lecture:
we were born with a lot of sophisticated skills---metabolism

414
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:38,840
heartbeat and so so forth. They all operate
in unconsciousness mode. Then because we need

415
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:46,010
to adapt, we need to survive, we learn knowledge
and we learn skills. Once we are familiar

416
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:52,810
with the skills they become our second nature.
We can then perform the skills habitually.

417
00:50:52,810 --> 00:51:02,740
However, our learned knowledge and skills
is never written back to the DNA. That's very

418
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:12,520
ironic, so our next generation they have to
learn reading, they have to learn biking all

419
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:20,599
over again. Evolution will not be helpful
for our future generations to be able to born

420
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:28,880
with the biking and the driving skills. This,
we can also address why in the next lecture

421
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:40,120
through a thorough investigation on the evolution
theory. Now we get to how to model subjective

422
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:50,560
consciousness. We know in machine learning
one of the most important constructs is distance

423
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:59,890
function. We measure similarity. Machine learning
tasks, for example, clustering or classification,

424
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:07,380
we need to measure similarity between instances.
We also need to be able to quantify differential.

425
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:16,210
Here this example shows classification in
machine learning. I argue all the classification

426
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:25,070
problems in machine learning considers a nearest-neighbor
problem. In this example we have two known

427
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:33,079
classes: one, rectangle blue, and the other
one is a triangle red. Now we have our unknown

428
00:52:33,079 --> 00:52:39,410
instance. We don't know its label sitting
in the middle of the circle, which is round

429
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:43,710
green. How should we determine the color and
the shape

430
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:50,750
of the unknown (unlabeled) instance? Suppose
we draw nearest neighbors using circle. We

431
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:57,650
have two circles here---one in solid line
one in dashes. The solid line circle is smaller.

432
00:52:57,650 --> 00:53:06,080
In that small neighborhood we basically look
into the labels of those instances. Here we

433
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:12,670
have three, two triangles and one rectangle.
And we perform a majority vote. They (the

434
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:18,480
neighbors) say: the instance
in the middle we are going to use red color

435
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:26,040
and triangle to label it. When we expand the
nearest neighbor to be larger, and now we

436
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:34,400
have five instances. Majority vote for us
in this case, we get "blue rectangle". I argue

437
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:40,490
all machine learning algorithms, regardless
whether it's a CNN top (neuron) level, or

438
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:47,030
support vector machines, and so on so forth.
All have the concepts of nearest neighbor,

439
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:53,619
and you measure similarity at the end is sort
of like a voting scheme. The label of the

440
00:53:53,619 --> 00:54:01,440
unknown instance is then obtained. So we have
two important measures, we need to be able

441
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:09,849
to quantify---the first one is: what is the
distance? how to measure distance between

442
00:54:09,849 --> 00:54:20,500
two instances? the second measure is what
is the definition of nearest neighbor. Let's

443
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:29,270
investigate further. Let's examine how do
we find nearest neighbor instances. Given

444
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:37,210
a point here we have this round blue dot in
the middle. Suppose we kind of simplify the

445
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:44,530
problem setting. Each instance has only two
attributes and one in the x dimension the

446
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:51,270
other one in the y dimension. The value of
each dimension ranges from zero to one. If

447
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:58,750
I want to find my nearest neighbor(s), i need
to give it a range. If i say range is everything

448
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:06,140
then you have to sequentially scan all your
data items. This is definitely not very efficient.

449
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:14,280
So, in data structures we have different tree
structures. The purpose of the three structures

450
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:22,290
is for efficient lookup. For range query in
this case, we'd like to be able to scan minimum

451
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:31,270
amount of data to find all the nearest neighbors.
In this example here, suppose we say my nearest

452
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:37,630
neighbor i can define to be a half of the
value. So f value is a fraction, and let's

453
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:44,740
say it's 50 percent. Dimension here is equal
to two. So nearest neighbor is 25% of the

454
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:54,040
area of the entire feature space. When d value,
d is the dimensionality of the data, and it's

455
00:55:54,040 --> 00:56:03,420
getting larger and larger. Suppose we say
fraction is equal to 0.9. And 0.9 when the

456
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:15,100
dimension goes to about 100, then the volume
basically is the fraction power of d, approximates

457
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:21,359
to zero (0.9^100~0).
This means the instance in the middle cannot

458
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:29,470
find any nearest neighbors! All the so-called
nearest neighbors are very far away because

459
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:39,190
the fraction of your search, range query,
is already 90%. How do we mitigate this problem?

460
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:43,940
How to address this problem? There has been
many methods. I'm not going to get into details.

461
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:51,099
In the first lecture we talked about dimension
reduction, we talked about all these different

462
00:56:51,099 --> 00:56:55,210
methods. Then we said well maybe transfer
learning may be pre-training, maybe other

463
00:56:55,210 --> 00:57:00,400
means.
We try to... the the good thing is all the

464
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:06,970
data they don't just randomly spread out in
the future space. The objects tend to have

465
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:16,230
similar attributes, and therefore, we are
looking at the problem of clusters of objects.

466
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:21,410
Similar objects are highly clustered in the
feature space. So, that saves the day for

467
00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:24,210
this
classification problem. If we can find just

468
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:30,040
a few clusters, then do attention. right?
We talk about top-down attention. At the top

469
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:35,790
we say there are this uniform distribution
situations we are dead. But there are 20 or

470
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:42,130
30 classes out there, and let's look at two
or three most likely clusters and we then

471
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:48,839
we zoom in our attention to it look into each
of these clusters. We may suffer from a lower

472
00:57:48,839 --> 00:57:56,931
recall because we may miss some good clusters.
But the searching speed will be higher. Once

473
00:57:56,931 --> 00:58:02,690
we get into the clusters, the precision of
course is not an issue.

474
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:12,191
Now, distance function. This is a very essential
topic for AI and at the end i'd like you to

475
00:58:12,191 --> 00:58:16,730
think about do we have the right distance
function today?

476
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:23,160
Do you remember when we talked about NLP,
the history of NLP, we said well we need to

477
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:27,589
quantify the distance, similarity, between
words, and we said

478
00:58:27,589 --> 00:58:35,380
well we have problems of synonym and polysemy.
Synonym may be easier you can do clustering

479
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:40,619
but polysemy can be more challenging.
Although clustering can handle the problem,

480
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:46,420
but for polysemy, we need to deal with it
very carefully (is) when we have contextual

481
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:51,290
information.
So let's look at distance functions in the

482
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:57,420
past. How we choose our distance function?
In Minkowski function basically if we have

483
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:05,470
two objects x and y and each object has k
attributes, k can be ranging from one to maybe

484
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:14,119
one thousand, and then we just say objects
x and y, we go through their attributes and

485
00:59:14,119 --> 00:59:21,490
compare all the attribute differences then
sum them up. There are different ways to quantify

486
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:27,270
this sum. The first way is saying oh i want
to square the sum because i don't want to

487
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:32,569
worry about negative positive. I just want
to do a square of distance then i sum them

488
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:37,390
together. The second method is, again i don't
care about positive negative, i just care

489
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:42,950
about distance, i do this absolute value.
The third one is that, well you have squared

490
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:48,140
why not have different kind of exponential
number just have q in general then you just

491
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:56,580
normalize using 1/q. We call the first one
Euclidean distance, second one Manhattan distance,

492
00:59:56,580 --> 01:00:03,700
and last one Minkowski. function in general.
For the manhattan distance they call that

493
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:09,370
because it's like a street-block distance.
You look at every dimension, you don't do

494
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:18,990
a square. Euclidean you use a straight line:
straight-line distance between two points.

495
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:26,210
Which method is better for vision? According
to all the empirical studies in the past,

496
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:34,040
Manhattan function seems to work better. Although
intuitively you want to say maybe Euclidean

497
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:39,240
makes more sense right i just want to know
the straight-line distance between two points.

498
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:46,760
But the trouble of Euclidean is the square
over there. When you have a square means when

499
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:53,970
you have a minority number of attributes that
they have large differences, then they will

500
01:00:53,970 --> 01:01:01,730
impact your distance function non-proportionally.
For example, suppose you have one or

501
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:06,850
two outliers, and they have a difference of
20. The rest of the attributes difference

502
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:14,030
is only, let's say, 0.2. then this 20 or 10
when they you have an exponential over there,

503
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:20,980
power of 2, then those two attributes will
dominate your similarity measurement. Therefore,

504
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:27,550
manhattan is better, you don't have the problem.
And some folks even use q equal to 1/2, right?

505
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:32,790
Say, well one is good, one is better than
two, why not just a half?

506
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:39,660
We want to normalize the distance to make
sure all the attributes enjoy equal importance.

507
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:47,230
But that's really empirical study to figure
out. The second family of function is called

508
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:53,619
cosine function. You must heard about this
really often. In high dimensional space people

509
01:01:53,619 --> 01:01:58,980
tend to use this one because computationally
you just do a dot product, and you can get

510
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:06,760
a distance function (measure). And..., but.
Let's think about attention and consciousness

511
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:14,339
now. What we have depicted so far, let's just
think about the Euclidean distance function.

512
01:02:14,339 --> 01:02:27,150
The distance function, do you think it works
in unconsciousness mode or consciousness mode?

513
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:35,030
Because once the distance function is already
there, if i ask you a question of: "Do you

514
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:44,599
think New York and LA, are they similar or
not?" You cannot process using your consciousness.

515
01:02:44,599 --> 01:02:49,180
You have to obey the distance function. The
distance function would say, there are many

516
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:53,720
attributes when you want to compare those
two cities, and you can compare every single

517
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:59,109
attribute and you sum together. That's your
answer. There's no subjectivity, right? But,

518
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:03,112
that's not the way
humans compare similarity between objects.

519
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:13,600
These (on the slide) are the progress in psychology
or psychiatry in the last 100 years. First

520
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:23,920
of all in 1928, psychiatrists believe objects
are similar in all respects. This is Minkowski

521
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:29,390
function. You consider all attributes, the
only difference is the exponent, square or

522
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:43,849
q. After 50 years and we have a new theory
by Tversky---objects are similar in some respects

523
01:03:43,849 --> 01:03:49,109
not all respects. Certain respects you can
ignore. It came out with weighted Minkowski

524
01:03:49,109 --> 01:03:53,930
function. You have to put a weight in front
of each attribute. Certain weights can be

525
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:57,560
lower and certain
weights can be higher. If you don't care about,

526
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:04,900
let's say, once you have worn a mask, the
face recognition system should just dismiss

527
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:09,849
whatever in the second region (beneath nose).
I don't know why apple takes so long to come

528
01:04:09,849 --> 01:04:17,000
up with the new face recognition system. Now
you can unlock your phone even with your mask

529
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,660
on. But to me (it) still fails. I don't know
what the (iPhone) algorithm was working on?

530
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:30,859
But you can say it definitely downplays whatever
beneath your eyes. Similarity, in 1994, Goldstone

531
01:04:30,859 --> 01:04:36,250
saying similarity is a process of determining
the respects rather than using predefined

532
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:42,742
respects. And this really flips consciousness
and unconsciousness. (Function) one and two,

533
01:04:42,742 --> 01:04:46,910
the paradigm is really unconsciousness.
You are given a function and you don't even

534
01:04:46,910 --> 01:04:53,470
need to think. That's it. But Goldstone saying
no no no. You are in a conscious state, you

535
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:59,829
are determining the respects, not respects
already determined for you. Therefore, in

536
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:06,309
this example I put in one of our publications,
which was quite interesting. The question

537
01:05:06,309 --> 01:05:14,440
is: "pick two cities similar to San Francisco."
I assume, let's don't do this experiment here

538
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:23,050
because time imitation. But my assumption:
out of you, you may pick different sets (of

539
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:24,180
cities).  

540
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:32,960
Why? because in my case, when I do comparison
I don't have a function to start with. Although

541
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:36,339
there are possible attributes down there (on
the slide) : location, climate, demographics,

542
01:05:36,339 --> 01:05:43,130
culture, and so on so forth. But, only when
i realize the objects i want to compare, let's

543
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:50,530
say, i start to compare San Francisco and
New York, and the respects surface on my consciousness.

544
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:56,650
I say oh San Francisco New York, they are
similar in maybe traffic. Definitely not similar

545
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:59,230
in location, (since) they are one east coast and

546
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:03,109
one west coast. And of course if the context
is different, oh they are both in the US,

547
01:06:03,109 --> 01:06:09,140
then that's a different story. The cultural
mixtures, they are similar, that they have

548
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:12,320
multiple cultures.

549
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:19,200
The attributes come out when you have the
objects surfaced. Let's say Los Angeles, or

550
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:26,479
Tokyo. Let's say Los Angeles is similar to
San Francisco. Los Angeles and and San Francisco,

551
01:06:26,479 --> 01:06:30,809
location wise they are close. But when you
say San Francisco and Tokyo, they say no no,

552
01:06:30,809 --> 01:06:35,970
they are very far apart. But some people still
consider San Francisco is similar to Tokyo

553
01:06:35,970 --> 01:06:42,540
because it's a metropolitan city and San Francisco
has a Japan town and Tokyo definitely has

554
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:47,430
a lot of Japanese goods and culture.

555
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:56,990
So, this comparison is really subjective,
and which respects you want to focus on is

556
01:06:56,990 --> 01:07:05,391
a consciousness operation rather than unconsciousness.
This really makes a huge difference when we're

557
01:07:05,391 --> 01:07:11,930
looking forward and when we want to quantify
similarity for the machine learning task.

558
01:07:11,930 --> 01:07:20,010
"Similarity is quantified only a pair of objects
being compared are realized." This is the

559
01:07:20,010 --> 01:07:26,780
key sentence. You cannot predefine the distance
function. How do we implement it?

560
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:34,450
We implemented 20 years ago with my student.
On the right-hand side you can see there are

561
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:41,059
m objects, and if you want to compare them
whether they are similar or not, based on

562
01:07:41,059 --> 01:07:50,260
their values here. You probably say, well,
for every pair the the common bits got flipped

563
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:57,339
to one, every pair is only two. Only minority.
So you say no, they are not very similar.

564
01:07:57,339 --> 01:08:04,940
But on the left-hand side example, you say
oh a1, a2, a3 could be similar because when

565
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:14,050
you do voting, majority voting, between two,
between each pair, they have three attributes

566
01:08:14,050 --> 01:08:20,279
similar---they have majority attributes similar.
They are not identical,

567
01:08:20,279 --> 01:08:27,970
but they have three attributes similar. So,
at the end our finding is the following: if

568
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:35,180
you look at this next picture and this is
way before this data augmentation (AlexNet,

569
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:43,180
2012) was performed. In year 2001, my student
Beitao, he said, well, giving me these 5000

570
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:50,310
images i'm going to do conversion on those
images, including converting jpeg to GIF,

571
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:56,000
and we crop images, we rotate images, and
then we scale certain images. When we crop

572
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:02,319
the images we make sure that the gist of image
remaining in the image. Like, say, a barbecue,

573
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:09,899
you keep the bbq relevant objects or features
still in the cropped image. Then we say we

574
01:09:09,899 --> 01:09:18,048
quantify every image---we do feature extraction
with three type of features, color, texture,

575
01:09:18,049 --> 01:09:24,500
and the shape. If you look at the picture
here we have 144 attributes for every image

576
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:30,880
(x-axis). Then we say okay we compare the
original image with converted images, transform

577
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:35,189
images. The first one (a) compared with GIF
images,

578
01:09:35,189 --> 01:09:40,798
basically we just changed the format. The
bottom one (c) rotated images, and on the

579
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:49,640
bottom-right (d): scaled images. Then you
look at the channels here, we have 144 attributes.

580
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:55,690
If we consider 0.02 (y-axis difference)

581
01:09:55,690 --> 01:10:03,110
to be the similarity threshold
we are willing to accept. Even in the GIF

582
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:09,730
conversion we can harvest maybe
a half of them, about 70 or 80 (attributes)

583
01:10:09,730 --> 01:10:14,110
in converted images to say: wow, they have
sufficient number of attributes similar to

584
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:19,130
the original image. If you look at rotated
images. Rotated images is very simple because

585
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:25,179
in a rotated image certain features wouldn't
change. It happens the first 108 features

586
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:32,590
are color features. If we rotate an image,
using any color histograms, the (color) features

587
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:40,050
would not change. Here you can say the differences
between colors are very small. And the scale

588
01:10:40,050 --> 01:10:44,420
images, color pretty much remain the same.
Color distribution remains the same, but texture

589
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:51,429
and shape may be different. And similarly,
cropped images you have more varieties, right?

590
01:10:51,429 --> 01:10:58,590
So let's say if we want to increase the threshold
to 0.1 (y-axis) and even in the cropped images

591
01:10:58,590 --> 01:11:04,050
you can find sufficient number of similar
objects because they have sufficient number

592
01:11:04,050 --> 01:11:10,330
of similar attributes. The idea to formulate
a distance function here, then is that we

593
01:11:10,330 --> 01:11:16,390
actually just want to have (similar) majority,
we don't care about which attributes. So,

594
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:23,610
for GIF images you see similar attributes:
some in colors, some in shape, and some maybe

595
01:11:23,610 --> 01:11:33,090
in texture. For cropped images the channels
with small differences are also distributed

596
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:39,400
in different features. Although in rotated
images, similar features tend to be in the

597
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:43,890
color channel. But once you say oh let me
give you a threshold let's say if you have

598
01:11:43,890 --> 01:11:51,460
108 attributes similar out of 144, i declare
those two images are similar. Otherwise, i

599
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:56,120
say those two images
are not similar. Just using this heuristic,

600
01:11:56,120 --> 01:12:03,830
we can detect all these kinds of transformed
images of the original image, very very accurately.

601
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:10,410
And when we competed with other state-of-the-art
results 20 years ago, we outperformed all

602
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:18,360
other methods, by just doing this very simple
change. The only question is how do you determine

603
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:21,969
the threshold (of similarity on y-axis)? The
threshold

604
01:12:21,969 --> 01:12:28,760
should be 0.2 or 0.4 or 0.1? With some top-down
hints,

605
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:38,410
this can be resolved. You just say  i already
told you the cropped images were cropped non-substantially.

606
01:12:38,410 --> 01:12:43,160
They should be similar to origin image or
you say scaled images should be the same as

607
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:50,790
the original image, you tell me that then
i can do reverse engineering to find out,

608
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:57,920
okay, given this particular set of attributes,
and given 144 features, how should i set the

609
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:03,970
threshold value so that i will accept enough
number of channels to be similar and declare

610
01:13:03,970 --> 01:13:10,900
those objects to be similar.
And to write down the formula, the formula

611
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:17,960
was not too challenging. Basically, we only
have these m and r two attributes, and we

612
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:25,719
have this delta m, which denotes the smallest
of m sigmas. You find the smallest m sigma's,

613
01:13:25,719 --> 01:13:32,270
m differences, and m is the threshold I just
mentioned about. So m all the 144, should

614
01:13:32,270 --> 01:13:39,340
m be 85 or 108? That should be done through
data mining. Once you have m then distance

615
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:46,860
can be quantified using this we call Dynamic
Partial function. Dynamic means every pair

616
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:52,920
of objects the distance function to compute
similarity would be different;

617
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:59,190
partial means you don't need to weight all
attributes in the distance function. You only

618
01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:07,530
pick the smallest deltas, or the smallest
attribute differences, to be into your distance

619
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:14,800
function. Although this method works so well,
but it's computational intensive. You need

620
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:22,500
to have all objects compared in a pairwise
manner. Therefore, I leave you the last slide,

621
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:29,230
and this could be some really interesting
long-term research. You look at our attention

622
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:38,780
model today. It's not good enough if you consider
top-down attention. The attention model today

623
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:45,320
is only doing bottom-up attention, because
we started from the lower-layer neurons then

624
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:49,550
we aggregate information eventually we have
a list of, we call features,

625
01:14:49,550 --> 01:14:58,630
high level features learned at the top. Then
we do attention, and finally we get our target

626
01:14:58,630 --> 01:15:07,710
task formulated. Here at the top level our
distance function is pretty much weighted

627
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:14,870
Minkowski function. Should that distance function
be modified so therefore we can do kind of

628
01:15:14,870 --> 01:15:21,862
pairwise realizations support subjective similarity
measures, and support dynamic to (adapt to)

629
01:15:21,862 --> 01:15:29,400
the contextual information. I think the answer
should be yes. This is an opportunity i consider

630
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:37,960
quantifiable to put system 2 above system
1.

631
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:47,500
This pretty much concludes the the lecture
today: what is consciousness. Next lecture

632
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:55,310
we'll talk about where is consciousness. You
may still feel what is consciousness, after

633
01:15:55,310 --> 01:16:05,800
today's lecture even with Kaku's intuitions,
with schrodinger's quantum mechanics and the

634
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:12,480
second law of thermodynamics, you still don't
feel easy about it. But when we learn more

635
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:19,350
about where is consciousness, i think we can
feel slightly more comfortable, and that will

636
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:29,270
be (covered) next Monday. Next Wednesday Dr.
Duvvuri will come back to wrap up his psychology

637
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:38,630
or psychiatry perspectives on abnormality
and normality of of the mental state.

638
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:47,429
Any questions you can send me after the lecture
and hopefully you have made good progress

639
01:16:47,429 --> 01:16:54,240
on your project. I will see you next week.
Thank you!
