00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:16,960
hi welcome back to cs372. today is lecture 
15. we cover where is consciousness.  

2
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:26,160
if you look at the roadmap of our lectures, and 
we are in the final lecture series of the quarter  

3
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:34,720
on consciousness and mind. and this is 
the third lecture. in the last lecture  

4
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:41,600
i covered what is consciousness. and 
i first motivated why did we study  

5
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,480
this particular subject: the reason was because 
our current ai hits some limitations including  

6
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:56,960
generalization problem and we cannot explain 
causality and so on so forth. therefore like  

7
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:04,319
yoshua bengio was saying we need to start to 
study system two. and system two is pretty much  

8
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:13,360
depicting consciousness. therefore we can model 
human thinking and we think logically sequentially  

9
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:23,840
and we do planning and reasoning. okay and we have 
been arguing whether system two or consciousness  

10
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:32,320
is computation all the way. and some scholars 
consider so and some scholars do not consider  

11
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:41,680
the same. when we get into where is consciousness, 
hopefully there will be more evidence to support  

12
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:52,000
one or the other. let's quickly review what 
is consciousness. there were many definitions  

13
00:01:52,720 --> 00:02:00,480
but i consider the ones who (which) can be
supported by science to be more promising.  

14
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,840
In particular, the proposal made 
by (Michio) kaku, a physicist at  

15
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,960
NYU, and he proposed that consciousness 
needs to consider time and space, which are  

16
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:25,760
evident and also the number of feedback loops. 
feedback loop means sensing and the response.  

17
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:33,440
flowers (plants) may have just limited number 
of feedback loops including temperature and  

18
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:41,920
water. for pets at home e.g., cats and dogs, 
they may have feedback loops for threats  

19
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,280
and for their hunger and interactions 
with their masters. and human has numerous 

20
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:57,440
feedback loops: we have five, six sensing 
organs--- we have our mouth, eyes, ears, skin---  

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,080
sensing sensations all the time. and when the 
(sensation) energy level reaches a certain 

22
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,520
threshold, as Schrodinger said, we 
would transition into the consciousness  

23
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,440
state. we try to handle these external
events and challenges. and we have emotion  

24
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,800
and other people have emotion. we 
conduct learning and we receive 

25
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:28,240
feedback on our learning for progress evaluation. 
so many many feedbacks that make a human 

26
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:37,440
being the most sophisticated being on earth. so 
quickly review this stimulus response diagram.  

27
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,640
we started from stimulus.
to human being we started from  

28
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:53,760
the sensory circuits, and we can perceive sights, 
and we can hear sounds, smell odor or fragrance,  

29
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:02,800
and taste different food, and so and so forth. 
the sensual qualities, as we discussed last time,  

30
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:10,240
will be brought to our nerve system---our 
brain. our brain consists of billions of neurons  

31
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:16,480
divided roughly into two parts: our 
cerebellum manages unconsciousness,

32
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,440
and our cerebrum manages consciousness. and 
eventually consciousness or conscious state  

33
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,240
makes a decision on the 
corresponding responses to the 

34
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,960
stimulus. then we we finish 
this stimulus-response pathway  

35
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:44,480
another definition, or sort of discussion made
by a physicist, is made by Erwin Schrodinger.  

36
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:53,280
I found his "what is life" book to be really 
intriguing. he talked about evolution,  

37
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,120
he considered consciousness has something to 
do with learning and adaptation. and physically  

38
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:07,920
the transition between consciousness and the 
unconsciousness can be explained by physics laws. 

39
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:16,000
for the human state to transition from 
unconsciousness to consciousness and  

40
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,680
schrodinger says it's pretty similar to 
quantum jumps: when atoms could be in  

41
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,320
different states and only when the 
energy reaches a certain threshold  

42
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,640
then the quantum jump may occur 
or occur with a probability.  

43
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:39,280
and likewise our sensing organs, let's say our 
skin we sense some itchiness but not severe, 

44
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,640
it doesn't really trigger a response. but only 
when the itchiness reaches a certain threshold  

45
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:56,240
or consciousness aware about the itchiness and 
we start scratching our skin. but on the other  

46
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:03,760
hand we talk about transition from consciousness 
to unconsciousness Schrodinger uses the second law  

47
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:11,120
of thermodynamics to depict the phenomenon. 
the second law says in the close system and  

48
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:18,560
the entropy in the close system will continue to 
increase until the entropy is maximized and when  

49
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:28,320
that happens the system is in the inert state. 
the example i gave a few times, like driving or  

50
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:36,400
we learn how to walk. initially we need to really 
pay attention to these activities in a learning  

51
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,400
mode. but eventually they became routine 
and habitual to us and they will fade into  

52
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:49,840
unconscious state, and only until some 
unexpected event happens, for instance, an

53
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:57,760
unexpected pedestrian shows up in front of us, 
then we are brought back to the conscious state to  

54
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:06,960
deal with this kind of novel challenge. we have to 
plan to react to try not to hurt this pedestrian.

55
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:17,920
Observations: we talk about the transitions, we 
talk about needs and wants, and we will expand  

56
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:25,600
the discussion shortly. we last time talked 
about top-down attention is in consciousness  

57
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:31,920
and bottom-up is from unconsciousness into 
consciousness and finally unconsciousness  

58
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:41,440
is loaded with inherited skills. when we were 
born and we already can do very sophisticated  

59
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:49,360
organ operations. even let's say you ask us to 
start to learn how to operate our heartbeats  

60
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:56,480
or changing heart-beat rhythms i think it 
probably cannot be learned. so the tough skills we  

61
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:04,000
inherited through dna, and at the same 
time all the learned skills on the earth:  

62
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,320
like we learned how to bike and swim, they never 
got written back to DNA. so we don't pass the  

63
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:16,720
DNA of swimming to our children, they just have 
to relearn everything we learned from afresh.  

64
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:27,040
so this is rather interesting and ironic and this 
is touching the notion that i talked about wants  

65
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:34,160
and the needs. it seems to be (i just briefly 
talked about discussed here), it seems to be what  

66
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,200
what are essential to survival, or what are the 
needs, respond to needs will pass through DNA  

67
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:51,520
to our offspring. but what are optional, like 
our wants to have a new iphone our wants to  

68
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:58,880
be happy living in the better house, and those 
are really not passing along through the DNA. 

69
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,680
Look at another problem, unconscious to 
conscious, last time we didn't talk about it  

70
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:13,040
was unconsciously, different organs 
or sensory circuits are collecting  

71
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:20,160
information simultaneously.
Our eyes, our nose, and skin, they collect 

72
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:30,240
respective signals at the same time. But only 
one consciousness at one time. in other words,  

73
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,840
the consciousness is working single-threaded.  

74
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:44,000
the question here is actually twofold: 1) is 
this kind of limitation of human we can only do  

75
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:50,000
one thing at a time? we only have one self, 
we cannot have multiple selfs or multiple  

76
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,520
consciousness existing at the same time. if 
this is a limitation to a human, suppose we  

77
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:03,840
want to build a robot, do you think a robot can 
have multiple consciousness at the same time?

78
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,560
so this is your homework number one.  

79
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,640
the assignment will be given 
to you at the end of today.

80
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,360
We have two questions about cancer and two 
questions about consciousness. The first question  

81
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:27,680
here is why one self and one consciousness?
My own hints are the the following.  

82
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,200
I remember in the 90s i worked on the 
first generation of multiprocessor  

83
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,040
at DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation)
even let's say we started with four cpus  

84
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:45,040
and we need to have this called spin lock on 
the top to try to synchronize those cpus. you  

85
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:51,840
can consider it's like a scheduler on the top. 
and from the notion of writing to the memory or  

86
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:58,720
writing to a file, you know we always want to be 
able to ensure consistency. consistency means that  

87
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,000
there is an earthly order of events. you write 
something you read something... if the order  

88
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,800
gets messed up, then inconsistency may happen. 
let's say you withdraw certain amount of money  

89
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:17,760
then you pay for certain merchants. if the order 
is out of sync then someone will lose money.

90
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:26,080
So even simultaneously many things can be 
going on in the background, there should be  

91
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:32,640
one central scheduler. In the multi-processor 
situation we have to do synchronization. 

92
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,080
The second notion is that 
human may be constrained by our  

93
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,200
physical situation because we only have one 
body. we only have one pair of eyes, and we have  

94
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,960
two hands and two legs. Even we say our sensation 
on the left-hand side and on the right-hand side,  

95
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:01,040
both are urgent or need to act on some 
responses, but physical body can only 

96
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,920
do one thing at a time, (e.g., 
turning right or turning left).

97
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,080
We argue this could be the limitation of 

98
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:16,160
one body of a person. when we implement 
on a robot do we have the same constraint?  

99
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:27,520
This is the question i think encouraging you to 
discuss and express your thoughts. Next, where is 

100
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:35,280
consciousness? Karl Deisseroth (a Stanford 
professor), today pretty much we're presenting his  

101
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,800
findings and his research results. 
He considers "knowing where" is  

102
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,720
very important. Just like everyone,
we agree that we live on this earth,  

103
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:55,680
we have this 3D Cartesian space. And we have 
the notion of time. If we don't have memory  

104
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,200
then time may not exist. Memory is essential 
for us to conduct reasoning, and therefore,  

105
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:09,120
time is a byproduct of the memory. And 
then Deisseroth talks about values, and 

106
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:17,280
values are important for human to 
evolve and for human to get rewards,  

107
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:25,280
so we do planning to get maximum rewards. I will 
come back to talk about value shortly. Values,  

108
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:34,240
there are two sets of different values: one set 
of values is for survival and even those could  

109
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:42,560
be brutal. Let's say i'm really hungry or a lion 
is very hungry. A lion has to hunt another animal  

110
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:51,760
and that's the intrinsic value or "needs" of 
lions. and you may judge lions to be brutal, but  

111
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,600
from the evolution perspective, the 
value assessment should be neutral. 

112
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,840
However, from the moral perspective we 
are not judging "needs", we judge "wants". 

113
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:08,960
You say oh you have no problem to survive but you 
are stealing things from other people. those are  

114
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:17,040
kind of distinct values once that is intrinsic,
the other side is so like for "wants."  

115
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:24,240
Different! Let's come back to visit those. But 
why do we need to know where is consciousness?

116
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:31,920
And to be able to visualize consciousness, 
visualize the stimulus to neurons, 

117
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:40,720
and also responses generated by neurons, we can do 
quite a few remarkable things. In the next slide  

118
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,160
we get into details and but let's first
talk about a mechanism discovered by  

119
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,840
Deisseroth in a very surprised manner. It is the
communication mechanism between neurons.  

120
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,000
Neuroscientists always thought neuron 
communication should be local. Consider  

121
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:09,280
our skin we feel itchiness. Itchiness, let's say 
on my palm. Palm is very small, relatively small,  

122
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:15,760
compared with my entire body, maybe five percent 
of my body. So the neurons get into communication  

123
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:22,560
of this itchiness shouldn't be very very vast, 
right? We consider to be maybe okay five percent,  

124
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:28,720
ten percent of the neurons. But it turns out 
there is a broadcast effect: the broadcast  

125
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:36,880
effect means although sensations may be regional, 
but when the sensations is about to raise into 

126
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:43,440
the conscious state, yet it broadcasts to all the
neurons. Other neurons may be managing other  

127
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:51,840
sensory circuits. the reason of doing so is 
because we only have one consciousness, and the  

128
00:15:51,840 --> 00:16:01,360
consciousness is only single-threaded. We cannot 
ask our consciousness to deal with two sensory  

129
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,000
circuits at the same time. Let's say walking 
to the left and running to the right. Broadcast  

130
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:13,440
seems to be a mechanism to just let everyone 
know the current situation so some can back down  

131
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,200
a little bit and some can just move forward. 
In a sense, it is a kind of prioritization  

132
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:30,720
based on urgency, or based on intrinsic values.
OK. This is the book, this is the foundation of  

133
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:41,440
of today's lecture "where is consciousness". 
Karl Deisseroth published this book last year.  

134
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:51,200
This is a distinguished book not only in its 
scientific content but also literature excellence.  

135
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,720
As we talked about which is 
also mentioned by Deisseroth,  

136
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:08,720
we want to visualize our brain, we want to find 
out causality. And Deisseroth's team in around  

137
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:16,880
2001 to 2005, they invented a new technology 
called optogenetics. I will talk about this  

138
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:23,840
method compared with the traditional electrode 
method. Which one is probably more flexible?  

139
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:32,480
Why optogenetics becomes, or is becoming 
the mainstream recently. It's also critical  

140
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:43,120
to go back to revisit values. Intrinsic value
is required by evolution survival, and extrinsic  

141
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:51,360
one is optional and then moral assessment will 
be involved and that will be covered in the next  

142
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:59,840
lecture: ethics. You may be surprised that we will 
be able to quantify certain ethical behaviors,  

143
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,840
even that we can quantify sins. OK, let's defer 
(discussing ethics) until the next lecture.

144
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:16,240
For intrinsic values and we have a set of 
mental disorders covered by Deisseroth.  

145
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:24,800
A mental disorder, what we call disorder, 
means our needs, it goes to one direction but  

146
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:32,240
our mental reaction/mental response goes to 
the other direction or the opposite direction.  

147
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,600
One example is eating disorder, to which we will 
give a tremendous treatment in this lecture.  

148
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:47,520
Our intrinsic value will say oh we have needs to 
eat when we are hungry; otherwise, we'll be dead.

149
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:55,040
We are thirsty we have to drink. But 
for eating disorder patients, they defy  

150
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:05,040
these fundamental needs and the challenging 
issue for a psychiatrist is to find out why.  

151
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:12,000
If you don't know why then the 
diagnosis is really really ambiguous  

152
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:19,120
and the treatment is virtually impossible. 
Before we get into more details let's  

153
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,720
review how the brain structure works 
and so get us get some foundations. 

154
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:34,160
Our brain consists of about 16 billion neurons 
(in cerebral cortex) or probably even more  

155
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,240
(in total, about 86 billions). The neurons 
interact with each other, connect to 

156
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:48,800
each other through uh synapses. Let's go into 
details to understand how it works and then we can  

157
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:54,800
understand how these different visualization tools 
and why one is more effective than the other. 

158
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:06,160
We see a neuron on the bottom left the input to 
the neuron is a number of dendrites and you can  

159
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:14,560
consider dendrites to be the branches of a tree or 
the root branches of a tree, which get nutrition  

160
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:22,640
from the soil. Likewise the dendrites here they 
are input ports getting signals, electrical  

161
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:30,080
signals or chemical signals, from their upstream 
neurons---can be thousands of neurons. And then  

162
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:39,200
the information eventually converts to electricity 
in the soma. Soma is the main body of the neuron  

163
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:46,480
and then the electricity flows through the axon 
pipe and reaches eventually to axon terminal. 

164
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:56,160
The synonym of axon terminal is synaptic terminal 
and you can consider that as an output port.  

165
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:06,720
On the right hand side we see this how the input 
and output works in this synapse. The output  

166
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:15,920
ports, axon terminals, emit either electricity 
or chemicals. when the emission is in chemical  

167
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:24,720
then there's a gap between the output ports
and the input dendrites. Here we can ignore  

168
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:31,840
the chemical transmission because eventually 
when chemical reaches the other side, the next  

169
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:38,320
neuron, or the downstream neurons, the signals 
will be converted to be electrical anyway. So  

170
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:46,480
we can in general thinking about only electrical 
information getting passed around between neurons. 

171
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:56,240
Today treatments to mental disorders only 
mitigate symptoms not really addressing the causes  

172
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:04,000
because we simply don't know the causes. Suppose 
we can collect neuron activities of a disorder.  

173
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:11,760
Then, both precision diagnosis and precision 
treatment will be possible. But how can we collect  

174
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:18,880
neuron activities? Given a disease and we need 
to have visualization instruments. There have  

175
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:27,360
been two visualization technologies developed for 
visualizing neurons. The first one is electrode,  

176
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:35,840
which was developed about a century ago, and 
the second one is optogenetics. Electrode  

177
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:44,560
injects current into neurons. There are two major 
metrics to measure the effectiveness of electrode  

178
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:52,160
technologies. One dimension is temporal dynamics, 
or how long the current can be applied to neurons;  

179
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:58,320
the second one is the spatial resolution, or how 
many neurons will be covered by this stimulation.  

180
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,160
Of course we would like to have fine grained 
control or fine grained stimulation. Therefore,  

181
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:11,280
they call this resolution or the spot size should 
be as small as possible. And unfortunately,  

182
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:18,320
according to the survey of Hong and Lieber 
done in 2019, although the spot size can be  

183
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:24,080
further reduced, and this is really similar 
to the Moore's law on the speedup of CPU,

184
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:32,080
the reduction of spatial resolution can 
also be further achieved by about 10%  

185
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:40,800
every year. But the sensitivity of the neuron 
to electricity can be an issue. The duration  

186
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:47,760
of electricity exposure cannot be too long. For 
monitoring a mental disease, typically we need  

187
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:56,160
to cover the patient for days or even weeks.
Therefore, maybe using light is less invasive. 

188
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:03,040
Indeed using light not only we can 
have better resolution and we can have  

189
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:11,040
longer temporal coverage. Also, light can
reach deeper neurons without much trouble.  

190
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:22,720
This optogenetics technology was developed by 
Karl Deisseroth in early 2000s, and later MIT  

191
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:32,320
professor Ed Boyden also joins the effort. The 
basic technology is the following. First of all,

192
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:40,400
it was motivated by the fact there are certain 
bacterias swimming under water and they would  

193
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:46,960
swim toward light,. Once light can shine on the 
bacterias, the light turns into electricity,  

194
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:53,040
and the bacteria gains their energy. The same 
idea if we can apply (plant) this kind of  

195
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:59,840
photosynthetic photo-sensory 
molecules' DNA into the neurons,  

196
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:06,800
then potentially we can shine light on a neuron 
and the the neuron would be (kind of) triggered,  

197
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,560
or the neuron would generate electricity 
and pass to the downstream neurons.

198
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:21,200
The light can then be used to turn on and turn 
off these neurons. There can be some remarkable  

199
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:28,240
resolutions done. The first one is that we can 
target individual neurons, the second one is  

200
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:35,120
we can target different types of neurons by doing 
gene therapy. Of course there are limitations,  

201
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,440
which we will cover in the end of 
the lecture. There have been some  

202
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:47,440
promises: there are several animal trials going 
on and the two clinical trials already ongoing:  

203
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:54,720
one for blindness treatment the other one for 
retna degeneration treatment. The following is  

204
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:03,520
a short video instructed by Boyden on this 
optogenetics technology. Let's take a listen.

205
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,640
Brain is made of maybe thousands 
of different kinds of cells called  

206
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,040
neurons that are built into very dense 
international networks that communicate  

207
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:20,160
each of these neurons compute to use electricity 
this cycle implements behavior and thought and  

208
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,760
emotion all these different kinds of things we 
also think that deficits and these electrical  

209
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,920
computations underline many brain disorders that 
affect over a billion people around the world  

210
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,400
in optogenetics what we're doing is repeating 
molecules that convert light and electricity  

211
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,080
into neurons to cells of the brain 
they're only sharing a bite on those  

212
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,000
neurons light gets converted to electricity 
and allows us to turn on or off those cells  

213
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:48,080
the goal here is to find a way to control the 
electrical activity in some cells and not others  

214
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,360
network to do that we had to turn to the natural 
world it turns out that dropping all the kingdoms  

215
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,640
of life in plants and funguses and bacteria and 
so on you can find photosynthetic or photo-sensory  

216
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,920
molecules that convert light and electricity so 
we borrow these molecules from nature and using  

217
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:08,560
tricks from the field of gene therapy we can 
put them into neurons now these molecules can  

218
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,960
convert light to electricity and they do it 
just in the neurons that we want to control  

219
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:18,240
and not all their neighbors so we can deliver 
these molecules to some cells throughout others  

220
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,760
and then we shine light on the network we 
can turn on or off that subset of the cells  

221
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:27,040
if we can turn on or off the set of cells 
that's embedded within this sense matrix  

222
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:31,600
we can figure out how do they contribute to a 
behavior for example if we can turn on a set of  

223
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,000
cells we can figure out what kinds of behaviors 
can it initiate if we can turn off the set of  

224
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,520
cells then we can delete it momentarily and 
figure what is necessary for so by being able  

225
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,760
to dial in information in the cells in the brain 
and to delete them we can try to figure out how  

226
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:51,040
they contribute to networks and the behaviors 
and diseases that arise from brain computations  

227
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:56,000
we can cut down the exact set of cells that 
are contributing to a specific disease state  

228
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,600
or which when activated or shut down will remedy 
that disease state that's very important because  

229
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,640
right now a lot of drugs are developed that target 
molecules but molecules are found throughout  

230
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,800
the brain and in fact many cells in their brain 
might be very molecularly similar to one another  

231
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,840
if we can target circuits in the brain though we 
might be able to develop much more specific drugs  

232
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,720
imagine if we could hunt down the exact set of 
cells in the brain that would activate a remedy  

233
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,360
of brain disorder and then we can go in and look 
at the exact molecules of those cells maybe we can  

234
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,400
find drug targets that are much more specific 
than existing ones you might also imagine that  

235
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,400
we can use option genetics to directly control 
brain circuits in patients with brain disorders  

236
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,200
electricity is used to stimulate the brain 
and deep brain stimulation if instead we can  

237
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,320
actually aim light at certain cells and turn 
them on or off we might be much more specific  

238
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,480
rather than use electricity to turn on and 
off the cells of the brain and have many  

239
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,640
kinds of cells activated you know the ones we 
want to affect as well as all their neighbors  

240
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,680
if we can make just one disease-associated 
subset associated with light  

241
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,120
and we can turn them on or off and be able 
to treat them with much more specificity...

242
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:11,840
Once we have collected massive amount of training 
data, which consists of neural activities and  

243
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,600
also the target diseases, we can turn 
this data into a classification problem.  

244
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,440
The training data has X and Y. 
An x (in X) instance consists of  

245
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:27,680
neurons, their locations and their 
activities, temporal and spatial, and y

246
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:35,920
is the dependent disorders. Given a lot of 
data then we can train a function f and then  

247
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:43,680
remarkable things can be performed. The first part 
is diagnosis. Given a set of unseen data X, we can  

248
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:50,800
say well what is the disease of this patient. And 
also of a non-disease (normal person), we see a  

249
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:56,880
certain pattern. We then know precisely which 
neurons need to be turned off. This could be  

250
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,880
a much more precise treatment procedure 
developed for mitigating mental disorders.  

251
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,640
I have used the term disorder several times.
When we say disorder means something is not  

252
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:19,200
normal. When we claim some behavior is abnormal,
we have to have a standard showing normality.

253
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:28,960
The disorder can happen biologically or morally. 
A moral disorder could imply non-ethical  

254
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,480
or illegal behaviors. Here we don't 
talk about morality until the next  

255
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:42,800
lecture (lecture #17). We focus on biological 
disorders. According to renowned biologists,  

256
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:50,400
when we talk about a biological disorder, 
we have to talk in the evolutionary terms. 

257
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:58,800
And accordingly, for example, the quote from Peter 
Medawar (upper-left). He said "for a biologist  

258
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:05,440
the alternative to thinking in 
evolution terms is not to think at all." 

259
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,840
Thus, let's revisit the term evolution. I
think we heard about this term before.  

260
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:20,960
Some of us may have some misunderstanding. 
Now, about evolution as related to genomics. 

261
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:28,560
evolution refers to the process by which living 
organisms change over time through changes in  

262
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:35,360
the genome. Such evolutionary changes result 
from mutations that produce genomic variation  

263
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:42,640
giving rise to individuals whose biological 
functions or physical traits are altered.  

264
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:50,720
The part that causes confusion is 
mutations. The question is: first  

265
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:59,840
is a mutation a random process or a mutation 
has a mission to adapt to the environment. 

266
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:09,760
in other words is mutation a process of 
passiveness? or mutation actively tries  

267
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:17,600
to adapt an individual's biological functions and
physical traits to fit the changing environment?

268
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:27,840
The fact is that the mutation itself is purely 
random. It is independent of the environment.  

269
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:36,080
Individuals that are better adapted 
tend to survive and produce more  

270
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:43,280
offspring, while the less well adapted 
tend to die or produce fewer offspring.

271
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:53,360
Let's use an example to illustrate the random 
process of mutation. Hundreds years ago a brown  

272
00:32:53,360 --> 00:33:03,120
hill at the new Mexico state. The mice over 
there, their color was in light brown. About  

273
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:12,440
100 years ago a volcano eruption happened over 
there, and the dark lava covered the land. Within  

274
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:21,120
about 30 years almost all mice turn their color 
into dark, the same color as the color of lava. 

275
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:32,000
Do you consider the mutation is targeted to be 
darker color so therefore the new generation can  

276
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:40,800
survive better? The answer is not really. Mutation 
is purely random. One of, say, 100 by chance would  

277
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:46,000
turn into dark and the rest will be probably other 
colors, or may tend to (remain to) be light brown.  

278
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:55,680
And because the background of the hill becomes 
dark, dark mice cannot be seen by the predators,  

279
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:01,280
by the eagles, so they can survive 
much better. According to statistics,  

280
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,040
if the survival of dark mice is just 
ten percent better than the brown mice.  

281
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:15,520
Just after about 20 years, all the mice on the 
hill would turn into the dark color. This is the  

282
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:22,560
power of just purely random mutation, and 
the selection is done by the environment. 

283
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:30,640
Mutation has no intelligence to target 
the mutation to fit the environment.

284
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:39,680
Now we have the evolution under our belt, we 
can come back to talk in biological terms.  

285
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:48,719
Evolution teaches us the fittest survives, and 
it's a nature law that survival of a species  

286
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:53,679
requires survival of the current 
generation and the reproduction  

287
00:34:53,679 --> 00:35:03,040
of the future generations. For survival we 
ask ourselves is hunger a normal sensation? 

288
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:14,320
Is eating a normal response to hunger? If 
we want to survive, then defying eating is  

289
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:24,720
not a normal behavior. Therefore, defying 
eating, eating disorder is not a normal behavior.  

290
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:34,160
Using evolution to judge whether 
biologically defying hunger is normal  

291
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:44,400
or abnormal makes a lot of sense. Why do we use 
eating disorder as an example to study neural  

292
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:53,360
visualization? It's because eating disorder 
is  probably the most sophisticated disorder,  

293
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:03,760
and also it's the most deadly and costly. There 
are about nine percent of the world population  

294
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,920
suffering from some forms of eating disorder.  

295
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:16,320
As the next step, we would like to 
visualize which part of the brain manages  

296
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:24,320
hunger, and after we have this hunger 
sensation appears on our consciousness, 

297
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:32,960
which part of our brain, which set 
of neurons, defies hunger? If we can  

298
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:40,720
locate the neurons defying hunger, maybe 
we can find treatments by turning them off.  

299
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:48,480
In the middle of our brain there's a structure 
called Hypothalamus, which manages our survival  

300
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:55,760
functions. If you look at the picture on the 
screen it's an orange structure buried in the  

301
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:03,680
middle. The functions it manages include releasing 
hormones, maintaining our daily physiological  

302
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:11,440
cycles, and controlling our appetite including 
thirst hunger, and also managing our sleep.  

303
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:19,360
Hypothalamus also manages our sexual behavior, 
emotional responses, and body temperature.

304
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:25,360
Again all these are basic survival 
functions (our biological needs)  

305
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:33,360
and with optogenetics we can successfully 
identify the neurons in this region, which  

306
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:40,400
manages each of these functions. 
So precisely for eating disorder,  

307
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:47,840
we can identify the neurons which manages 
appetite and neuroscientists already show that

308
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:58,080
they can successfully turn on or off the mice 
neurons for hunger. But here turning on or off  

309
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:06,880
the neurons for managing appetite is not helpful 
for curing eating disorder because if we turn  

310
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:15,600
hunger off, just getting the situation worse. And 
keeping the hunger sensation up, the person is not  

311
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:25,200
going to eat anyway. Let's visit these competing 
forces that cause eating disorder. First of all, 

312
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:32,800
Hypothalamus, which manages appetite broadcasts 
the hunger sensation to all the neurons.  

313
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:41,200
It's a conscious decision for the individual 
to defy the eating needs because of  

314
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,280
his/her value system---for the sake of 
beauty, the person insists in not eating.

315
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:54,880
Only the person with strong will 
would persist this defiance. 

316
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:05,680
And in time this defiance is able to collect 
or recruit sufficient armies in other areas  

317
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:14,080
of the brain to join this resistance.
We call this army as the "second self."  

318
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:24,640
The second self competes with the first self, 
constantly fighting for eating or not eating.  

319
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:32,640
Let us now making some observations. First 
of all a patient with eating disorder  

320
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:39,120
was first convinced of that losing 
weight is positive and rewarding;  

321
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:46,960
then the person turns defying hunger 
into a mission and a challenge,  

322
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,800
and neurons are then recruited to tackle these

323
00:39:53,440 --> 00:40:02,320
challenges. There's a strong correlation 
between a top performer at school or at work  

324
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:09,200
with a person suffering from eating disorder, 
because both top performer and eating disorder  

325
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:17,200
patient, they are goal oriented, they are 
strong-willed, they can formulate plans,  

326
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:24,160
and they can persist to tackle the 
challenge. Through neuron visualization,  

327
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:29,840
we (Deisseroth's team) have two findings.
The first finding is: although the structure of  

328
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:37,840
hypothalamus manages the hunger sensation and it 
broadcasts the hunger signal to all the neurons.

329
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:44,960
the neurons that participate in defying 
hunger is only a small minority. 

330
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:55,520
If we can somehow turn off these resistant 
neurons, we can perhaps cure eating disorder.

331
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:04,960
And also for other mental conditions, 
like the stress regulating brain area  

332
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:11,600
becomes larger in patients of depression 
and the bipolar. We may be able to  

333
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:20,720
manipulate the neurons responsible for 
stress regulation to mitigate the illness.

334
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:30,880
Now we understand mental disorders 
much better, and we appreciate  

335
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:39,040
these visualization tools, which can let 
us identify each neuron's functionality  

336
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:50,480
either positive or negative with respect to their 
biological function. And next we come back to our  

337
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:58,320
central mission: where is consciousness? 
the question we impose in the middle.  

338
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,520
Fortunately through visualization,
neuroscientists already  

339
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,040
are able to roughly identify the brain 
regions that manage our consciousness.

340
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:22,800
The method of visualization is the following. 
First, we can assume the area manages  

341
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:29,840
consciousness can be constantly busy 
and can be task independently busy. 

342
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:37,040
And secondly, if a person is put 
into a meditation state---thinking  

343
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:47,840
nothing and be very calm. If still there's an area 
of neurons being active, then that particular area  

344
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:57,840
may be the managing neurons and they could 
possibly be the region's managing consciousness.

345
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:08,640
Neuroscientists have already identified two areas 
in the brain where consciousness are managed  

346
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:21,040
or you can say consciousness resides. The first 
area is in this blue rectangle area which is our  

347
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:30,320
Prefrontal cortex, and the second area is 
in the red circle its name is Retrosplenial  

348
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:41,200
cortex. These two cortexes work in concert to 
manage our consciousness. The scientists right now  

349
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:49,840
continue conducting experiments on lab animals to 
see turning on or off neurons in these two areas,  

350
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:58,240
what would be the effect to the animal 
behaviors. Now, we have located consciousness,  

351
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:06,480
and we would like to probe further questions.
The first question is "is consciousness  

352
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:14,400
computational only?" There was a debate between 
Roger Penrose and Yoshua Bengio  (via me).

353
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:21,760
Yoshua considers that consciousness should be 
computation all the way, and Penrose agrees that  

354
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:29,840
our cerebellum, which manages unconsciousness, 
is computational only; but he disagrees that our  

355
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:39,120
consciousness is merely computational. My question 
is if it's not a computational, then what is it?

356
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:47,920
We could conduct further visualization 
to see the neuron patterns in these two  

357
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,440
areas (prefrontal and retrosplenial cortexes).
For computational activities, there could  

358
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:58,560
be one (or some) unique neuron activity 
patterns. If the consciousness area also  

359
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:06,800
exhibits the same pattern, then yes we can 
consider consciousness is only computational. 

360
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:15,360
But if there are other patterns emerge, 
then there is a possibility that there  

361
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:20,320
are other activities going on.
We can then conduct further investigation.

362
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:30,640
For optogenetics this technology is not 
without challenges. Before we can widely  

363
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:37,680
use the technology to be a therapeutic 
tool, we need to tackle a list of  

364
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:44,800
obstacles listed on the slide. I'm 
not going to get into details and  

365
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:51,360
if you conduct research in the area 
you can look into the problems and  

366
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:59,840
potential solutions. Finally i'd like to challenge 
you guys with discussion question number two. 

367
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:09,600
We know evolution involves in satisfying 
our fundamental needs, otherwise a species  

368
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:19,680
would extinct. For wants and we consider 
those are optional---those are luxuries.  

369
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:29,600
To preserve a species requires satisfying 
the needs managed by hypothalamus including  

370
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:33,840
maintaining organ operations,
maintaining our body temperature,  

371
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:41,840
balancing body hormones, managing 
eating, drinking, rest, and sleep. 

372
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:49,040
My question is "how about the 
wants?" All wants should be optional. 

373
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:57,360
"Is crying a need or crying a want?" We know  

374
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:06,000
subjective values like having good grades 
should be a want. If we all have poor grades,  

375
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:17,200
human species can still survive. But crying is an 
interesting trait. From the theory of evolution,

376
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:27,440
crying does not help us to survive. 
But why crying is a common trait.

377
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:42,960
One hint is the notion of evolution bottleneck, 
which was explained by Deisseroth as follows.

378
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:53,840
About 70,000 years ago there was a major volcano 
eruption occurred on earth, and that eruption  

379
00:47:53,840 --> 00:48:03,200
caused not only earthquake tsunami but also much 
ash dust and vapor in the air covered the sun  

380
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:11,520
for six years and also disrupted the seasonal 
rain. So lots of people vanished during the  

381
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:20,560
disaster. The earth suffered from a huge reduction 
in population. You could consider this is a  

382
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:30,880
biased sampling process. In the extreme case 
let's think about this Noah Ark. Noah just  

383
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:40,320
selected a pair of animals for all the species 
and the pair got selected is a minority sample  

384
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:50,080
of the original species population and this 
sampling is highly unrepresentative so suppose  

385
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:59,520
you pick a pair which happened to have the trait 
of crying, and crying was not the popular traits  

386
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,800
of the particular species. Then we (human) 
get into this so-called founder's effect.  

387
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:14,480
This may be the reason we have some traits right 
now which are not really equipped for survival.  

388
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:20,480
They are with us because of 
this biased selection process.  

389
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:28,080
The slide shows a biased sampling 
example. The population with a lot of  

390
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:37,120
white dots representing people without disease. 
But with the small samples (right-hand side) 

391
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:45,360
maybe the selected instances all suffer from 
disorders. So, when we today talking about  

392
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:53,280
some people may have disorders and ourselves may 
be normal and we have to be quite careful because  

393
00:49:53,280 --> 00:50:01,760
the truth may be the opposite. This kind of 
"founder effect" should make us more humble....  

394
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:10,240
And further reading I include two very good 
books. One is again Deisseroth's Projections  

395
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,080
and Roger Penrose's Emperor's New Mind. 

396
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:23,840
Roger's book depicts his vision about what 
is consciousness and where is consciousness.

397
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:33,760
In the next lecture dr duvvuri will come back 
to continue the coverage of psychiatry topics.  

398
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:46,400
The final lecture of the series i will cover 
ethics, love, and mind. My attempt is to quantify  

399
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:55,680
these three elements so therefore when we build 
a robot we can build a robot with good ethics,  

400
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:07,200
loving, and rich mind. Thank you for attending 
today's lecture. Hopefully your project  

401
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:16,640
is in good progress, and i see you on Wednesday.
