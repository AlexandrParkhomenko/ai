15 cases of toilet paper anyone here on

46
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:25,200
this call we're the slightly inflated

47
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,720
price of $10 a roll Wow do people not

48
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,300
know that they have showers if they

49
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,370
really got desperate right that's right

50
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,430
that's right water does the trick yeah

51
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,170
and and paper production is not

52
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,080
something that is gonna get disrupted

53
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,600
that's just anyway what about the milk

54
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,890
why are they buying up milk because they

55
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,540
like milk is this that's a that's a

56
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,040
blizzard thing everybody goes and buys

57
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,840
bread and milk before the blizzard I

58
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,930
don't know why and eggs and eggs right

59
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,040
and they wake up the next morning they

60
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,630
say I guess we'll have french toast

61
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,130
right yeah by the way I have a little

62
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,900
bit of breaking news three minutes ago I

63
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,790
did this email just came in from the

64
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,230
superintendent of my daughter's school

65
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,140
closing the schools for our whole

66
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,860
district until March 27th Roger that

67
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,480
so even here in western asked well we

68
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,010
don't have any confirmed cases yet

69
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,070
they're shutting it down yeah this is an

70
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,840
excellent decision yeah I agree

71
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,310
yes we're trying to convince the

72
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,180
governor of New York City to shut down

73
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,989
public schools it's a little more

74
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:29,790
complicated here because a lot of these

75
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,200
kids don't have anywhere to go during

76
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,019
the day right I think that it's

77
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:35,430
important because everything else is

78
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,350
pretty much she is gonna have that to

79
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,980
deal with but that's yeah yeah well

80
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,450
Ralph when you joined us back in

81
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,940
February on the 24th there were fewer

82
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,620
than a thousand cases globally most of

83
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,739
them in China Tsarskoe v2 talking about

84
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,430
in case anybody didn't realize sorry yes

85
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,680
talk about these days exactly yeah we're

86
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,140
well over well over hundred thousand and

87
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,420
I would just want to say New York City

88
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,150
so far has 328 cases with no deaths and

89
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,450
we have a good hospital system with

90
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,900
capacity and the governor has been

91
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,880
proactive in getting a testing online

92
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,410
it's important for the states to be

93
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:19,978
independent anyway Ralph let's chat with

94
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:24,300
you last time one of your key points was

95
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,470
that

96
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,170
looked like czars covetous community

97
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,150
spread which you said is different from

98
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,990
SARS one and has that been borne out in

99
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,120
our experience I think we're approaching

100
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,610
150,000 cases globally in the United

101
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,430
States we have 2,000 cases we may be a

102
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,760
few cases short of 2,000 cases so

103
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,260
there's no question there's community

104
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,850
spread there's no question that there's

105
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,560
a symptomatic spread and there's no

106
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,600
question that we are now in a full-blown

107
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,540
pandemic and that's 2,000 known cases

108
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,810
that's correct there are there's no

109
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,500
question that there are undetected

110
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,870
networks and transmission chains that

111
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,360
exist across the country that are

112
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,760
infecting additional people okay so

113
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,160
that's really by the way Ralph thanks

114
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,560
for being here this is terrific that's

115
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,540
really critical to me because I had

116
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,780
questions about this so asymptomatic

117
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,400
spread you mean that there are people

118
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,440
walking around who themselves are not

119
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,870
experiencing any symptoms but are

120
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,480
nevertheless infected and can't infect

121
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,480
other people correct that's what I

122
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,630
believe yes okay correct and then there

123
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,950
are people of course with mild symptoms

124
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,110
who may have they think they have the

125
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,310
flu or something else and they don't

126
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,800
bother to get check that all in they're

127
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,990
spreading virus as well right that's

128
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,440
correct so the the asymptomatic

129
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,270
asymptomatic spread is really is really

130
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,160
critical because that means that you

131
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,710
can't for example if you're questioning

132
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,350
whether or not to convene your regular

133
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,690
small meeting or something you can't say

134
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,940
we're safe as long as you stay home if

135
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,750
you're feeling sick that's correct okay

136
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,930
and looking looking globally one of the

137
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,490
things that stood out to me there's a

138
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,160
kind of a general notion in any kind of

139
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,530
emergency is that no news is often bad

140
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,390
news and there are a whole bunch of

141
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,550
countries in the world mostly poorer

142
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,250
countries that we've heard nothing from

143
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,550
right I think that all I've seen is one

144
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,980
report from Nigeria representing all of

145
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,570
sub-saharan Africa I haven't seen any

146
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:35,340
other subsets there are theirs that have

147
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,910
actually been okay the just

148
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,740
but there's a there's a paucity of news

149
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,550
and of reports from the whole region and

150
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,150
from Southeast Asia and from just large

151
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,880
swaths of the globe and and I'm

152
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,530
wondering yeah why should we should we

153
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,300
expect those sometimes soon as somebody

154
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,350
trying to get there and test people

155
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:05,430
about a month ago it was fairly clear

156
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,720
that there were only two places in

157
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,490
Africa that for example that could

158
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,500
actually do testing for the new virus

159
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,950
that's change now but in reality huge

160
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,970
tracts and nation tracts are doing

161
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:24,260
little if any testing and so this is

162
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:28,320
this is a problem also in other

163
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:34,500
countries around the world and and I

164
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,240
don't know what we can really do about

165
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,150
it in the United States we have our own

166
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,030
problems with tests yes speaking of

167
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,920
countries in third-world countries with

168
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,460
that testing system Ralph if you have a

169
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,530
case confirmed case what's your

170
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:55,350
estimation of how many other cases there

171
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,450
would be associated with that I've heard

172
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,310
all kinds of numbers ten hundred a

173
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,760
thousand give us the RO or the number of

174
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,640
people that become infected from an

175
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,260
infected individual arm is is estimated

176
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:15,390
somewhere between 2.5 and 3.2 that's

177
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,700
actually quite high that means that for

178
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,940
every case there is two and a half to

179
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:28,050
three additional cases contemporary flu

180
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,690
is much closer to two or one point eight

181
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:34,229
one point six you know so this is very

182
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:36,979
explosive spread and rapid transmission

183
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:40,200
it's even more explosive because you

184
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,890
have rare individuals or maybe not so

185
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,320
rare individuals who are super spreaders

186
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,810
who can infect 1520 people

187
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,450
just passing through room and I'd like

188
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,280
to throw in a shout out to any Biogen

189
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,890
employees who are listening at

190
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:00,800
Massachusetts now is number one in New

191
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,070
England for confirmed Tsarskoe b2 cases

192
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:07,820
and the vast majority of those so far

193
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,730
are due to a single meeting at Biogen

194
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,280
headquarters near Boston which resulted

195
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,800
in I think 77 people getting infected

196
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,770
when was that meeting that was just last

197
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,800
week or no that was sorry that was that

198
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,200
was a couple of weeks ago that was yeah

199
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,380
that was back in February and so Ralph

200
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,210
thanks for being here so there is now

201
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,020
confirmed evidence of super spreaders

202
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,460
there were there was confirmed evidence

203
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,380
of super spreaders by the Chinese back

204
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,090
on the 22nd of January where they

205
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,500
documented a single person infecting

206
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,330
thirteen healthcare workers so I don't

207
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,190
think there's ever been any doubt that

208
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,890
that's been well confirmed and that's

209
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,690
that's fairly typical of infectious

210
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:55,910
diseases though isn't it I am less super

211
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,530
spreaders from what I understand are

212
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,710
much more rare with influenza and okay

213
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,900
this this is probably this is clearly

214
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,050
common with the emerging ground of

215
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,250
what's not known as weather the

216
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,750
contemporary corona viruses have a

217
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,790
similar phenotype or not and it would

218
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,520
actually be a very interesting model to

219
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,130
look at is this a property of this this

220
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:20,030
family of viruses right yeah one of the

221
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,040
things I've seen bandied about also is

222
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,610
this doubling time of cases right I

223
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,560
don't know where that comes from do you

224
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,430
have some sense of that Ralph that

225
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:38,089
sounds like epidemiology to me aren't

226
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:44,060
you in the school of Epidemiology okay

227
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,930
that's why I'm feeling intimidated by

228
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,430
the question it's like we don't

229
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:53,390
necessarily to know the answers so the

230
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,310
the doubling time can be affected by a

231
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,970
large number of things one of which is

232
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,740
the incubation time

233
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,569
so in this case we have individuals who

234
00:11:03,569 --> 00:11:07,800
can Inc you may be exposed but don't

235
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,560
begin to show symptoms until 14 days

236
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,389
although most people are in the range of

237
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:14,730
5 to 7 days and they begin to show

238
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:19,439
symptoms the doubling time is also

239
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:25,379
dependent on population density probably

240
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:26,850
virus titer where the virus is

241
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,980
replicating in the upper respiratory

242
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,500
tract and exactly where in the upper

243
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,709
respiratory tract it may be replicating

244
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:38,850
that would help fuel rapid transmission

245
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:45,660
to contacts so in comparison for example

246
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,480
the incubation time and the transmission

247
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,500
time for flu is much much shorter so I

248
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,360
don't have a good answer I guess the

249
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,949
short answer is I don't have a good

250
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:56,939
answer for your question

251
00:11:56,939 --> 00:12:01,649
ok so we have 15 million flu infections

252
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:04,290
this year in the u.s. is that is that an

253
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,269
is that a number that we're going to get

254
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:11,420
at with SARS go V 2 you think the first

255
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,810
part of that depends on how well we test

256
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:18,240
and whether we begin to do serologic

257
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,910
testing so for example I've heard

258
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,259
recently that the Chinese aren't

259
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:24,540
planning on doing serology on their

260
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,339
population which tells me that there's

261
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:31,410
probably significantly more infections

262
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,720
than the 80 plus thousand that ported

263
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,579
and they don't want the actual number to

264
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:38,639
be report I imagine in the US and Europe

265
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,769
that those numbers will eventually be

266
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:43,470
reported certainly sir logical assays

267
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:48,149
are are are available now to begin to

268
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:51,230
look at those those types of questions

269
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,490
the big question is what is the

270
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:57,930
denominator how many right is the

271
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,870
denominator two or five times or 10

272
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,300
times higher than what we are seeing in

273
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,939
terms of clinical disease right and

274
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:09,000
actually seems fairly likely that that

275
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,949
denominator is significantly higher

276
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:13,380
which is good news because then the

277
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,580
mortality rates drop

278
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:20,190
accordingly for example is over 60 male

279
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,190
I'm I would hope that that die not

280
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:27,649
denominator is 10 or 50 times higher

281
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:31,079
than my my risk level would go down to

282
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:35,880
about 0.1% and I feel much better about

283
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,959
that than a 3% trouble is that if you

284
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:43,320
age just the cases and the acquisitions

285
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,600
and the severity z' it puts us in a

286
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,839
danger zone again I'd love to know how

287
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:51,300
many people have died what their average

288
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,640
age was and I don't know if we know that

289
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,620
figure or not well from an early study

290
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,950
in China we do yes we do yeah does it

291
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:03,450
remain the same so if you're over 80 the

292
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,940
mortality rate is just under 15% if

293
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,730
you're 70 to 79 and mortality rates 8%

294
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,610
if you're 60 to 69 is 3.4%

295
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,300
if you're over 50 I can't remember what

296
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,550
it is and if you're under 50 it's around

297
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:21,240
0.4 and if you're under 30 or 25 it's

298
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,540
less than 0.1 what was it in Washington

299
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,720
though because that was a place where

300
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,310
there were lots of elderly and in

301
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,120
immune-compromised I presume and their

302
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,450
death rate was fairly high as I recall

303
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,350
and I believe there's still a

304
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,880
significant number of people who are

305
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,430
intensive care so the actual reality

306
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,029
where that cluster is not not clear but

307
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:47,339
again that's a unique population there's

308
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:49,290
our elder leagues that are Co housed in

309
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:53,279
close proximity probably the most

310
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,360
vulnerable conditions to live under in

311
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,480
young me or an outbreak of the I guess I

312
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,620
call it the mo I'll call it the

313
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,390
Millennial virus it's everybody else is

314
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:06,810
coming up with new name I can also pick

315
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,390
on the Millennials that way right during

316
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,279
a baby boomer you know we got to get our

317
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:18,029
revenge perfect well and since give it

318
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:19,589
given the age distribution in the fact

319
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:21,240
that people in the Millennial age group

320
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,860
are mostly surviving it would be would

321
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,820
it be appropriate to say that

322
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,230
Millennials are killing this virus

323
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:30,520
well I have to I have to process that

324
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,420
for a little bit before any given the

325
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,580
large number of people who may be

326
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,950
infected can we expect some of those

327
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:42,460
people to have immunity to be may be be

328
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,470
protected against this virus in the

329
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,770
future

330
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,950
almost certainly and I saw some very

331
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,440
interesting data from Stan Perlman the

332
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,530
other day who has been looking at serum

333
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:59,040
neutralization titers of MERS patients

334
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,660
from the kingdom from the Middle East

335
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,570
king of Saudi Arabia area and it's quite

336
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:10,450
interesting that people peak fairly

337
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,370
quickly with high neutralization titers

338
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,920
but then they weighing over the next

339
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,630
year to almost background levels were

340
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,420
just slightly above background levels by

341
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,830
the second year and with with MERS there

342
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,980
have been several reports of people who

343
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,190
ser converted they were rt-pcr positive

344
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,920
and then their serum neutralizing titers

345
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,050
and even the lyza titers went to almost

346
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:42,700
zero within a few months so the and and

347
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,860
it has not been well studied but it

348
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,450
should be studied and this is the

349
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,030
contemporary human coronaviruses nobody

350
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,920
knows how they maintain themselves in

351
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,140
human populations they don't undergo

352
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:57,610
rapid antigenic variation like influenza

353
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:01,720
there's not a hundred and fifteen common

354
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,040
cold or corona virus type genotypes or

355
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,599
whatever they're called serotypes sorry

356
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,280
Vincent I just butchered the court of

357
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,010
artists so one hypothesis is is that

358
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:19,630
they cause a transient immune immune

359
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,670
response protective immune response that

360
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,800
wanes quickly and then they can reinfect

361
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,530
and cause mild upper respiratory tract

362
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:27,880
infections and that's how they maintain

363
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,550
themselves so it is quite possible and

364
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,500
there's been there's been a number now

365
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,860
of reported cases in China of SARS two

366
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,820
infections where people were documented

367
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,250
to be infected

368
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:45,570
and recovered they were rt-pcr negative

369
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,460
they went home and then they became

370
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,559
reinfected a month later or so so it's

371
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,700
an interesting question that you asked

372
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,049
fortunately the you fortunately that's

373
00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:00,059
not the right word please delete the

374
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:03,630
word fortunately in this case the United

375
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,850
States has sufficient cases that we can

376
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:08,070
actually track the sarala the serologic

377
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,559
responses of the individuals and their

378
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,960
general immune both B and t-cell

379
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,780
responses after infection and we can get

380
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:21,830
a handle on the the long-term immunity

381
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,049
that may be elicited after infection and

382
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:28,350
that's a factor I assume in what so

383
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,510
what's going on in China now at least

384
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,850
from reports I've seen is that they seem

385
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:36,120
to have seen a tapering off in cases and

386
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,530
of course the Chinese government is

387
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,270
promoting this as these draconian

388
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,520
measures that they implemented must have

389
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,820
worked another interpretation might be

390
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,980
that everybody who was susceptible got

391
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,289
infected and either immune or dead and

392
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:53,130
now the virus has burned out but

393
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,500
presumably that's one of the reasons

394
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,179
they're not going to do serology testing

395
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,370
there but that could that is something

396
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,470
that hopefully other countries will be

397
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,250
monitoring as this develops right I

398
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,900
think those are certainly excellent

399
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,520
points another potential point is that

400
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,260
the Chinese are primarily reporting

401
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,580
cases in their quarantine zones which

402
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,650
involve a hundred million people and

403
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:23,299
that the Chinese in rural communities

404
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:26,820
are not being picked up by their

405
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,650
surveillance systems right so this there

406
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,510
must be memory though it is as you say

407
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,940
maybe the second infections are milder

408
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,299
but what absolutely what that case in

409
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:41,370
the case of the contemporary human

410
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,720
coronaviruses they would they would

411
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,610
thought most the data supports the idea

412
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,350
that they're more they're much more mild

413
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,380
so that would still encourage us to make

414
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,080
vaccines because even then you would

415
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,180
have a milder secondary vaccine

416
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,650
right the advantage of a vaccine might

417
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,050
may well be that you include a an

418
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:03,180
adjuvant as a boost of immunity that

419
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:08,680
circumvents whatever anti viral gene

420
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:13,510
sets are present that are attenuating

421
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:16,540
the long term protective immune response

422
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,420
so Brianne do you think this is a

423
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,150
problem with memory or is it something

424
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,280
else

425
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,540
um it could be a problem with memory I

426
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,520
think that I would have to look a little

427
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,350
bit more closely at things like the

428
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,110
specific cytokines and some of the

429
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:39,340
t-cell data that we can see from some of

430
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:43,750
the patients but given the short term

431
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,410
persistence of the virus and the lac

432
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,520
sorry the short term persistence of the

433
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,650
immunity and the lack of antigenic drift

434
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,990
that Ralph mentioned I could certainly

435
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,300
imagine this being a problem with memory

436
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,520
and of course you're making me want to

437
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,990
run into the lab and start playing

438
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,960
around looking at some of this right now

439
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,640
let's say the global expert on that

440
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,380
would be stayin Perlman oh he would be a

441
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,820
wonderful person to have on the show

442
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,050
good idea

443
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:11,500
all right well and another possibility

444
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,330
though is that the virus just confines

445
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,830
itself to the very upper respiratory

446
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:19,750
tract and knows and so where it's

447
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,040
suddenly having to deal with the

448
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,500
pre-existing mucosal immune response

449
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,070
that is present which may be you know

450
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:33,430
may which may allow for a much more

451
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,410
transient infection before memory gets

452
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:38,170
boosted hmm potentially now I'm gonna

453
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,820
okay so when we're done I'm gonna call

454
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,950
my sister who's working on mucosal

455
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,890
immunity and ask her about it good I'm

456
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,320
not an immunologist so I probably

457
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:52,690
insulted half of the country how does

458
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:58,110
this stop do we have to have a certain

459
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:01,740
percentage of the population

460
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:06,040
with experience this infection and

461
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,900
become immune so that we develop on a

462
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,480
population scale an appropriate herd

463
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:17,000
immunity or perhaps seasonality a little

464
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,960
both when does this one what are the

465
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,450
circumstances under which this dies down

466
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,940
so this is the only way to answer this

467
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,100
course suspect is by speculation so

468
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,080
there clearly one approach is that if

469
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,940
you do not put in any intervention

470
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,890
strategies in and you allow the virus to

471
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,310
run its course eventually you'll hit

472
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:42,410
herd immunity levels where 70% of the

473
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,900
population has been infected and there's

474
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,900
sufficient herd immunity that protects

475
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,820
people from reinfection that drives the

476
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:54,140
ro of the the SARS to virus below one

477
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,990
and it it burns itself out and goes to

478
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,750
the extinction that's a brutal way to

479
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,110
handle a new emerging infection

480
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,250
basically everybody has to get infected

481
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:09,050
so so a better approach is to implement

482
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,900
Public Health intervention strategies

483
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:16,730
where you dampen the transmission rate

484
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,490
of the virus and reduce the number of

485
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:27,350
infections such that the number of

486
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,450
potential contacts that are available

487
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,540
for infection are significantly reduced

488
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,730
and that can also help to burn out the

489
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:40,220
outbreak ultimately I think long term

490
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,950
protection of the human population is

491
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:47,030
going to require herd immunity to reach

492
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:50,720
about 70% in our population and that is

493
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,820
it's gonna that's either gonna have to

494
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,380
be through natural infection or

495
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,510
vaccinations make sure that right

496
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,550
vaccination would presumably be the more

497
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,710
humane way to accomplish that my

498
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,920
preferred choice yes yeah Ralph do we

499
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,330
have a good understanding of why the

500
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:07,870
original SARS outbreak burned itself out

501
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:12,260
sure there are three drivers for the

502
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,060
original SARS outbreak the first was

503
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,960
that we had a known animal resident

504
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,060
or which were civets and raccoon dogs

505
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,070
that were transmitting virus to people

506
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:23,940
in open markets so if you call all those

507
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,880
animals and close the open markets that

508
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,640
was the you effectively blocked that

509
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,620
transmission chain the second

510
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:35,100
transmission chain was that hospitals

511
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:39,300
were acting as in essence of

512
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,050
amplification centers where patients

513
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,790
would inoculate other patients and

514
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,020
healthcare workers who would inoculate

515
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,740
other patients and to stop that barrier

516
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,770
nursing had to be employed rapidly and

517
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:56,040
dramatically and that reduced the the

518
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,530
opportunity for hospital settings to be

519
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,080
major amplifiers of disease and then the

520
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,170
third was that SARS coronavirus

521
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:06,030
transmitted 24 to 36 hours after you

522
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,700
developed clinical disease consequently

523
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,850
quarantine and contact tracing allows

524
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,500
you to isolate those people in

525
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,300
sufficient time so that they couldn't

526
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,730
transmit and the combination of all

527
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:22,110
three blocking all three pathways or

528
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:25,700
transmit transmission chains led to the

529
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,230
vro or the reproductive rate of the

530
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,760
virus to fall below one and went extinct

531
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,930
Wow we we don't have any we don't know

532
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:40,790
what the animal reservoir is for SARS -

533
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,380
and importantly what people aren't

534
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,570
thinking about is that as you have a new

535
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,810
emerging virus that has a novel receptor

536
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:51,260
binding interface as compared to SARS

537
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,300
circles the globe opportunities for new

538
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,630
animal reservoirs hmm are now in the

539
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,520
United States and Canada and South

540
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,510
America and Africa and Europe and so we

541
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:07,500
could suddenly see through some common

542
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,500
animal in the United States being a

543
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,270
reservoir for this virus for the future

544
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,280
and so that's something that we need to

545
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,830
look at as far as I know no one is

546
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,540
looking at that in the United States or

547
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:22,350
elsewhere went from animals to humans in

548
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,540
China then circled the globe in humans

549
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,420
and now the main reservoir it presumably

550
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,820
as humans but as you point out

551
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,740
that's a really interesting possibility

552
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,860
that we can then infect animals in our

553
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,710
environment that then become future

554
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:41,250
reservoirs including bats including bats

555
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,500
including bats and so the virus could

556
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,890
cycle back in and then begin to undergo

557
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:51,120
recombination and mutation driven

558
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,890
selection to pool out new variants that

559
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,870
could come out again in the future

560
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:58,320
so what species in nature do we know

561
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,340
about that harbour coronaviruses now

562
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:04,890
said all over the place if a mammal or a

563
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,900
bird it's probably got a corona virus in

564
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,750
it right but stars like corona viruses

565
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:13,380
SARS like carnal viruses are in bats and

566
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,440
also panda lands yeah turns out and Peng

567
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,400
so true so as far as you know our other

568
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,070
Chinese are people in China I was told

569
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,500
not to say the Chinese scientists people

570
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,500
in China working to still find out what

571
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,450
the animal that transmitted the

572
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,580
infection was because we know it was

573
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,320
originally in bats because of the

574
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,880
sequence homology but what was the

575
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,780
actual immediate transfer right right as

576
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,340
far as I know they have they have not

577
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,530
identified the actual reservoir species

578
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:46,260
the closest there were there were

579
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,720
reports about panda lands as potentially

580
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,720
being the intermediate host but panda

581
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,510
land viruses or 88 90 percent identical

582
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:59,010
to SARS - in comparison civet and

583
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,320
raccoon dog strains of SARS coronavirus

584
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,310
were 99.8% identical the SARS

585
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:08,340
coronavirus from 2003 in other words

586
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,720
you're talking about a handful of

587
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,140
mutations between civet strains raccoon

588
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,190
dogs drains and human strains in 2003

589
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,830
panda lands have over 3,000 nucleotide

590
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,450
changes no way they were the reservoir

591
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,430
species absolutely no chance

592
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:27,150
okay so it's unknown I know they're

593
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:29,430
looking yeah but I don't believe they

594
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,020
have found it yet or if they found it

595
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,820
the paper has not been published yet but

596
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,890
it does raise that it does raise the

597
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:38,790
important question that other reservoir

598
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:42,240
hosts could become very important for

599
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,620
maintaining the virus

600
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:49,230
human populations throughout the globe I

601
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,150
know we talked about this last time but

602
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:54,140
I'd like to revisit as a check

603
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:58,620
seasonality is there what's your

604
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,920
expectation or understanding about

605
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,230
potential seasonality for this virus

606
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:09,240
that is as the weather changes will it

607
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,860
have an effect on the infection it

608
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,110
should reduce the ro rate it won't drive

609
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,860
it to extinction I don't believe so the

610
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,870
the typical peak season for

611
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:25,470
coronaviruses are early winter to early

612
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:30,660
spring SARS for example peak cases were

613
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:35,010
in April and even very high numbers of

614
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:38,010
cases in May through the end of May the

615
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:40,679
virus went extinct SARS coronavirus went

616
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:44,010
extinct by the end of July summertime

617
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:46,910
will reduce the rate of transmission and

618
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,800
so these explosive amplification

619
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,660
probably won't occur but the virus will

620
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,920
continue to spread into human

621
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,850
populations

622
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:58,370
it does somewhat use the rate so

623
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:01,080
sunlight warmer temperatures humidity

624
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:05,460
all reduce the the viability of virus on

625
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,070
surfaces and contacts bread is probably

626
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,740
an incredibly important means of

627
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,840
spreading the virus from person to

628
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,940
person so what's happening right now in

629
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:30,300
the Philippines there are trying to make

630
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,920
sense of this okay a great great

631
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,300
somebody's gonna get rid of it but what

632
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:38,300
happens or Iran yeah or Iran or

633
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,000
Australia where it's currently summer

634
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,740
all those are true all those are those

635
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,600
are very very good points there was a

636
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,050
case in Brazil - so right like I said if

637
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,540
I'd to be very clear that it would not

638
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,780
stop the spread of the virus it may

639
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,210
reduce the rate of spread

640
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:59,850
of the virus now if you have very dense

641
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,820
populations in close proximity that's

642
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,480
going to be mitigated by the sort of the

643
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,490
human population demographics of each

644
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:11,429
area I think also the immunity levels

645
00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:12,870
make a big difference there's zero

646
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,700
immunity right there's zero immunity

647
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,350
across the globe so that's going to also

648
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,840
make a big difference so the idea that

649
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,279
the virus will go extinct in the

650
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:24,330
summertime is not going to happen I am I

651
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,429
am holding out hope maybe that's the

652
00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:27,990
better way to say it I am holding out

653
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:30,360
hope that the rate of transmission goes

654
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,830
down in the summer which would make it

655
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,059
more vulnerable to Public Health

656
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,279
intervention strategies and I and I

657
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,350
guess we'll see a combination of things

658
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,720
since the virus emerged in the late

659
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,669
winter by summer we should see herd

660
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,590
immunity in most populations worldwide

661
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:49,080
starting to emerge and at the same time

662
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,520
we'll have the increasing temperatures

663
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,529
and humidity maybe a combination of

664
00:31:52,529 --> 00:31:54,240
things is gonna going to help drive it

665
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,510
down and school gets out well know

666
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:06,630
school now that this rate right and I

667
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,340
think those are all important features

668
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:11,159
that would that would help sure we

669
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:13,230
should point out that flu influenza is

670
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,929
seasonal in temperate climates like ours

671
00:32:15,929 --> 00:32:18,720
but it's also seasonal in the tropics

672
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,390
and we have no idea what drives that

673
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,850
seasonality right because in temperate

674
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,710
climates it's as ralph said

675
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,140
low humidity low temperature but in the

676
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:32,250
tropics it's hot and humid so what's

677
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,169
going on there Ralph what's the fraction

678
00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:37,880
of roughly that droplet transmission

679
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,240
versus that contact for SARS Cova - do

680
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,720
we know unknown okay but both make a

681
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,090
contribution right I believe so I think

682
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:50,789
the the cruise liners have clearly

683
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:53,130
demonstrated that's the case there were

684
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,320
examples of workers who were putting

685
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,090
trays down in front of people's rooms

686
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,710
who weren't coming out because they were

687
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,960
mmm sort of like germaphobes

688
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,299
but they were still getting infected mmm

689
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:06,659
what about fecal oral transmission well

690
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:08,429
it's a real possibility mmm that

691
00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:10,080
happened with SARS one right

692
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,450
did the Amory Gardens outbreak was a

693
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:16,500
community condominium that aerosolized

694
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,929
feces when you flush the toilets and and

695
00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:21,330
that went into the ventilation system

696
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,909
and infected people on multiple floors

697
00:33:23,909 --> 00:33:26,929
of that building in fact the plumes of

698
00:33:26,929 --> 00:33:32,190
aerosolized virus feces mixtures drifted

699
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,659
out of the building out of the top of

700
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:35,669
the building on to other condominiums

701
00:33:35,669 --> 00:33:38,539
and infected people in them as well so

702
00:33:38,539 --> 00:33:42,450
it is certainly possible plumbers can

703
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:45,779
save lives that's right now we come back

704
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:48,330
to toilet paper yes now we come back to

705
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,029
toilet

706
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:53,820
well you wonder about things like the

707
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,010
restroom facilities and Airlines and you

708
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:58,320
know on airplanes mm-hmm pretty big

709
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,200
vacuum there does that generate an

710
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,250
aerosol or not

711
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,320
well it's interesting Lee it's not a

712
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:09,030
it's not exactly a vacuum it's the the

713
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,889
air pressure is being directed sort of

714
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:13,460
downward and into a holding tank

715
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,149
contrary to what some people believe

716
00:34:15,149 --> 00:34:16,770
that it's not actually flushing to the

717
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:21,899
outside so so I would expect oh so I

718
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:23,429
don't have to look up when I walk around

719
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:26,730
anymore seven oh right so so most most

720
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:29,310
airplane Oh in fact it's a it can cause

721
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:31,800
a major disaster if any of that holding

722
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,679
tank content leaks out and puts ice on

723
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,859
the outside of the plane but I would

724
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:39,989
expect actually airplane lavatories to

725
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:41,960
do a pretty good job of aerosolizing

726
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,639
material and hopefully the treatment

727
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,219
chemicals are as effective against SARS

728
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:50,219
go v2 as they are against other better

729
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:52,320
known pathogens I think an airplane is

730
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,210
not where you want to be right now most

731
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:56,219
no definitely don't forget our program

732
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,630
and some we should we mentioned last

733
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,270
time that you know the air is mostly

734
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:02,070
recirculated we have an email about that

735
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:04,770
where basically they don't take in a lot

736
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,359
of air from the outside because it's

737
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:08,310
expensive to heat it up so you're

738
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:11,580
getting a lot of recirculation so I on

739
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:15,200
this topic we had an arc years ago about

740
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,800
the difference between airborne and

741
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,750
aerosol I aerosolized

742
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,550
I don't know

743
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:26,650
what words to apply here but this is

744
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:29,150
there's different degrees of this right

745
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,440
when you talk about droplet transmission

746
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:36,050
you're talking about virus on air at

747
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,690
least briefly airborne droplets but that

748
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:42,130
don't stay suspended in the air and drop

749
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:44,870
but rather drop to the ground or

750
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,700
whatever ultimately correct um as

751
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,280
opposed to the word I'm gonna use

752
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,790
correct me if I'm wrong is airborne

753
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:54,860
where you have particles that are so

754
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:58,700
small that they can be maintained

755
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,360
airborne for a long period of time and

756
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,330
long distances am i talking sense here

757
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,850
that's correct as far as I understand it

758
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:13,300
yes that's and and so where does

759
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,000
coronavirus and I assume that this is a

760
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,610
continuum right different droplet sizes

761
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,950
different times in the air different

762
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,750
distances that they can travel not a

763
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:26,810
black and white thing what's your

764
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,550
understanding of where the corona

765
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:33,830
viruses fall in this everyone that I

766
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:36,500
hear talk that discusses this concept

767
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:40,520
always our argues that it's large

768
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:44,930
droplets spread okay that's the major

769
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:48,530
mediator of disease I think I

770
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:51,610
fortunately people kind of use aerosol

771
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:54,320
interchangeably especially a mass media

772
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,180
right and it's not rice correct right

773
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,620
that's one of the reasons I wanted to

774
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,790
bring this up not only for my

775
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,790
understanding but for other people's

776
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,660
understanding as well because there's a

777
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,850
you know this really impacts on how you

778
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:08,260
how you think about the transmission

779
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:13,730
that's all I mean I would assume based

780
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:17,360
on that that recirculation of air in an

781
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,060
aircraft in an aircraft would not

782
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:24,620
necessarily be a huge source of virus

783
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,630
but a but I don't you know I don't

784
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:30,980
really know how aerosolized or airborne

785
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,230
particles behave in that circumstance

786
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:35,850
but I think of

787
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:38,350
droplet transmission as something that's

788
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,150
not going to stay suspended in the air

789
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,950
for very long or over very large

790
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:46,630
distances I think with SARS the few

791
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:50,040
examples of transmission on an airplane

792
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,660
the radius was about six to eight feet

793
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:55,750
from an infected individual [ __ ] mm

794
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:58,300
okay so not a lot of roll for air

795
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,120
circulation that's right okay of course

796
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,120
this is a new virus yeah right we don't

797
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:08,380
know it's a new day it's a new day you

798
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,590
know we haven't seen anything like this

799
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:15,330
I don't think in a hundred years

800
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,890
certainly no one has also explained how

801
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:21,610
super how super spreaders infects so

802
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:24,910
many individuals troops so are there are

803
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:27,040
these rare individuals that can that can

804
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,210
drive airborne spread you think it's a

805
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:34,620
matter of dose in a droplet that you get

806
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,190
where I think

807
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,750
I think certainly there's there's

808
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:41,410
probably some infectious dose what

809
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:44,800
exactly that is is not clear but but I

810
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,740
believe in the in in Canada there was

811
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,600
one example of a super spreader who

812
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,870
simply walked through an emergency room

813
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:56,320
that was packed that was fairly packed

814
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,990
with individuals and infected 19 people

815
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:02,590
in the less than the 15 seconds they

816
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,510
were in the emergency room as they walk

817
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,370
through it wow that's like measles

818
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:10,060
that's like measles yeah so has there

819
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,890
been have there been studies done on

820
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:16,000
whether super spreaders have higher

821
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,600
titers than others oh I don't know I'd

822
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,980
have to check the literature I don't

823
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:26,560
they certainly had documented four or

824
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,470
five cases of super spreaders with SARS

825
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:32,290
I believe the the Saudis have also

826
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:36,970
identified ten to fifteen cases of super

827
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:39,100
spreaders that they probably have that

828
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,740
data whether there's sufficient numbers

829
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:45,430
to make it significant is is a is an

830
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,740
open question we talked a little bit

831
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,120
about the actual

832
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,970
infection so you know there's mild

833
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:57,560
infections more serious when people are

834
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,210
getting more serious infections we have

835
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:00,830
pneumonia I because of the viruses in

836
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:01,970
the lung so what's happening when the

837
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:08,300
virus gets down there so as he as he

838
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,850
mentioned 83% of the cases seemed to be

839
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:16,400
mild without any requirement for

840
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,380
hospitalization about 17% require that

841
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,050
are typically could be hospitalized that

842
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:26,590
require some sort of respiratory support

843
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,380
so the virus causes a pneumonia the

844
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:36,890
virus specifically it the most severe

845
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:39,230
cases that develop a disease called

846
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:42,050
acute respiratory distress syndrome are

847
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:45,320
at extremely high risk for lethal

848
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:50,500
infections and the virus replicates in

849
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,870
cells lining the airways especially the

850
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:57,220
smaller Airways as well as the alveoli

851
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:00,170
although I they've only been to

852
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:03,980
pathology reports and so this is based

853
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:08,870
on limited information what most likely

854
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:11,330
happens in the alveoli is it destroys

855
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:13,490
type 2 and type 1 cells that line the

856
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:19,190
the airway epithelium exposing the

857
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:22,310
alveoli to fluids that can diffuse

858
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:25,700
across the capillary beds and result in

859
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,650
flooding of the capillary bed and this

860
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:30,020
results in drowning in essence here your

861
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:33,080
little balloons that transmit oxygen to

862
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,770
your red blood your bloodstream become

863
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:40,910
water balloons and so you drowned in

864
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:44,630
your own fluids the repair system can

865
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:49,610
also go a little bit out of whack and

866
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:52,520
that's a highly highly a few minor

867
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:56,540
medical terms out of whack yeah there's

868
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:00,170
a problem I like the end and patients

869
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:02,460
can undergo a pro fibrotic response with

870
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,380
layer down multiple layers of fiberglass

871
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:08,730
cells on the interface and between the

872
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:12,270
alveoli and the capillary bed and this

873
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:14,280
results in multi cell thickness layers

874
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,080
of cells and the oxygen now can't

875
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,820
diffuse across it to get into the red

876
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,670
blood cells to oxygenate your tissue and

877
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:23,220
now it's death by suffocation both cases

878
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,830
you end up with hypoxia that leads to

879
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:29,520
multi organ failure and then death it's

880
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,849
and this is this is pretty typical viral

881
00:42:32,849 --> 00:42:34,940
pneumonia right

882
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:37,740
not all viral pneumonia is lead to acute

883
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,740
lung injury okay is this similar to what

884
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:44,430
SARS one did is it's exactly the same

885
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:46,619
disease phenotype that SARS and MERS do

886
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:51,869
as well as h5n1 and h7n9 so all of these

887
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:53,730
viruses well it's a similar acute

888
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:56,580
respiratory distress syndrome the NIH s

889
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:58,109
but literally spent hundreds of millions

890
00:42:58,109 --> 00:43:01,280
of dollars trying to figure out how to

891
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,589
treat this end-stage lung disease and

892
00:43:04,589 --> 00:43:07,080
they've actually done quite a quite a

893
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,330
good job of reducing the mortality rates

894
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:11,369
from 50 percent where it used to be a

895
00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:13,680
couple decades ago to about 25-30

896
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,800
percent now but it's still a very very

897
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,310
difficult disease to manage clinically

898
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:21,869
and are we seeing are we seeing people

899
00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:23,580
getting secondary bacterial infections

900
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:29,390
with this know it the cause of death

901
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:32,430
seems to be exclusively viral pneumonia

902
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:36,030
leading to a Q lung injury without any

903
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,650
evidence of secondary bacterial

904
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:40,349
bacterial infections qualities well is

905
00:43:40,349 --> 00:43:44,280
there a role for a cytokine storm say in

906
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,960
any of this pathogen kind of storm

907
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,460
certainly plays a role in that whole

908
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:50,520
process of acute lung injury yes and and

909
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,640
why are kids less than nine not having

910
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,200
any of these issues do we understand

911
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,880
exactly my question

912
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,000
that's a great question they have very

913
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,089
high titers of virus they have there's

914
00:44:03,089 --> 00:44:05,250
no reason I mean they they should

915
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,589
transmit efficiently to those around us

916
00:44:07,589 --> 00:44:11,460
around them which is a good reason why

917
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,099
we should close schools to protect their

918
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:15,579
parents not

919
00:44:15,579 --> 00:44:18,190
yes exactly and don't forget their

920
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:21,459
grandparents my grandkids are with us

921
00:44:21,459 --> 00:44:24,549
today that's right grandparents being a

922
00:44:24,549 --> 00:44:26,890
grandparent yes I'm in favor more

923
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:31,150
grandparents in the world so your are

924
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:33,910
the spoilers that's right

925
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:37,299
so that's right that is our role yeah so

926
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:38,979
Souter a child like that was a super

927
00:44:38,979 --> 00:44:42,160
spreader I don't think anyone has done

928
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,400
enough work to know the actual burden of

929
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,019
spread that's associated with young

930
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:51,670
children at this time in the in the

931
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:53,019
expanding pandemic

932
00:44:53,019 --> 00:44:54,880
I believe that data will be out there

933
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,190
and I believe believe that the contact

934
00:44:57,190 --> 00:45:00,519
tracing is occurring that will inform us

935
00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:02,920
but I have not seen the papers that

936
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,150
doesn't mean that they haven't been

937
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:06,459
published yet but I think we're going to

938
00:45:06,459 --> 00:45:08,259
find some very very important

939
00:45:08,259 --> 00:45:10,390
information about that in the coming

940
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:13,930
months why did what they get back to why

941
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:16,089
children don't don't experience their

942
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:21,039
severe disease when they examine the

943
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:23,969
lungs of the children by x-ray or other

944
00:45:23,969 --> 00:45:27,609
non-invasive approaches they are clearly

945
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:30,130
diseased and they are they're clearly

946
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:32,650
infected and have pathology in their

947
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:36,239
lungs but they don't show any symptoms

948
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:42,329
why is that part of it may be related to

949
00:45:42,329 --> 00:45:45,369
the ACE two molecule the the receptor

950
00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:48,249
for the virus which plays an important

951
00:45:48,249 --> 00:45:53,789
role in homeostasis but exactly how that

952
00:45:53,789 --> 00:45:57,880
could contribute is it's not clear so I

953
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,329
don't know the answer to the question I

954
00:46:01,329 --> 00:46:03,670
know that the Aces of the cygnets phylum

955
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:06,009
of AIDS I mean do they did they develop

956
00:46:06,009 --> 00:46:08,589
fevers I don't know the answer I should

957
00:46:08,589 --> 00:46:09,969
know the answer that question but I

958
00:46:09,969 --> 00:46:11,529
don't know the eye does anyone else on

959
00:46:11,529 --> 00:46:14,709
this on the comments I I don't know the

960
00:46:14,709 --> 00:46:17,499
one thing that I have seen from Sally

961
00:46:17,499 --> 00:46:21,069
Parmar who is a pediatrician and

962
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:23,039
infectious disease specialist at Duke

963
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:25,150
was that she was speculating that

964
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:26,229
perhaps there were actually

965
00:46:26,229 --> 00:46:28,150
physiological differences in children's

966
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:29,150
lungs

967
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:32,109
that were causing some of the difference

968
00:46:32,109 --> 00:46:35,869
I was talking to another well-known

969
00:46:35,869 --> 00:46:39,019
violinist who was explaining why RSV

970
00:46:39,019 --> 00:46:40,759
might be more severe in the lungs of

971
00:46:40,759 --> 00:46:42,349
children and it was because the Airways

972
00:46:42,349 --> 00:46:45,769
are smaller so these cells of the air

973
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:46,579
whit them when the airway epithelial

974
00:46:46,579 --> 00:46:49,400
cells slough off then that clogs the the

975
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,180
airways and prevents oxygen exchange

976
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:56,539
SARS and this SARS 2 virus grow very

977
00:46:56,539 --> 00:46:59,299
well in primary human airway cells and

978
00:46:59,299 --> 00:47:01,249
they cause the airway epithelium cells

979
00:47:01,249 --> 00:47:03,380
to slough off but that would that would

980
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:05,839
have a tendency to drive you know based

981
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,180
on that hypothesis and SARS too should

982
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:10,789
be causing much more severe disease and

983
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:13,430
obstructive disease in the airways much

984
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,049
like RSV and that's not what's being

985
00:47:15,049 --> 00:47:18,740
seen so okay I don't know it's it's a

986
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:22,490
fascinating question but it may reflect

987
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:25,549
also the biology of these viruses in

988
00:47:25,549 --> 00:47:30,109
general corona viruses infect young

989
00:47:30,109 --> 00:47:33,559
children and cause mild disease most of

990
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:34,849
us become immune to the kemper

991
00:47:34,849 --> 00:47:37,339
contemporary corona viruses within the

992
00:47:37,339 --> 00:47:39,650
first few years of life and that

993
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:43,190
immunity may well be saving us as adults

994
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:46,940
from viruses that are much like emerging

995
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:49,099
corona viruses in terms of they have an

996
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:51,349
innate capacity to cause much more

997
00:47:51,349 --> 00:47:54,249
severe disease as a function of age

998
00:47:54,249 --> 00:47:56,239
they're saying there may be cross

999
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:59,329
reactivity of some extent between I'm

1000
00:47:59,329 --> 00:48:01,489
saying that we as a scientific community

1001
00:48:01,489 --> 00:48:04,640
have defined contemporary human

1002
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,890
coronaviruses as mild common cold

1003
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:10,670
diseases yeah when in reality the all of

1004
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:12,859
these emerge from animal reservoirs yeah

1005
00:48:12,859 --> 00:48:15,019
a hundred eight hundred years ago and we

1006
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:17,599
have no idea how severe they were an

1007
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:22,009
adult and naive adult populations most

1008
00:48:22,009 --> 00:48:24,349
likely they weren't they were probably

1009
00:48:24,349 --> 00:48:27,739
brutal diseases just like SARS MERS and

1010
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:29,150
SARS - are mm-hmm

1011
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:32,089
adult individuals who as they get older

1012
00:48:32,089 --> 00:48:34,220
and that actually if that hypothesis is

1013
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:37,099
true then the prediction would be that

1014
00:48:37,099 --> 00:48:40,230
as SARS - goes around the globe

1015
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:44,369
and infects the adult population we will

1016
00:48:44,369 --> 00:48:47,089
become immune and the virus will now

1017
00:48:47,089 --> 00:48:49,859
preserve itself in the population by

1018
00:48:49,859 --> 00:48:51,540
infecting young children who don't get

1019
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:55,410
serious disease as they grow up they are

1020
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:58,500
pre immune and so they never get serious

1021
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,990
disease and SARS too will now be

1022
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:03,440
relegated to the role of being a benign

1023
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,970
common contemporary coronavirus that

1024
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:08,660
somehow lost its pathogenic potential

1025
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:10,890
when the real reason had lost its

1026
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:12,630
pathogenic potential is that all the

1027
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:15,980
dark adults are now immune yeah got it

1028
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:20,369
if that's the case then we have a one

1029
00:49:20,369 --> 00:49:23,700
two three a year pandemic that we will

1030
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:27,329
be facing until sufficient herd immunity

1031
00:49:27,329 --> 00:49:32,310
occurs to drive the virus into this into

1032
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:36,119
this catalyst this type of persistence

1033
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:39,869
mechanism ma minh populations until the

1034
00:49:39,869 --> 00:49:43,230
next one comes about that's right and an

1035
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,930
important thing to note is that there

1036
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:48,270
are two human coronaviruses that are in

1037
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:49,859
the group one that are very closely

1038
00:49:49,859 --> 00:49:52,619
related in group one there are two human

1039
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:54,920
coronaviruses in the group two a current

1040
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,900
cat a phylogenetic grouping that are

1041
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:01,160
closely related and both are both cases

1042
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:04,050
they Co circulate in human populations

1043
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:05,730
and don't appear to provide cross

1044
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:10,550
immunity so a single SARS like virus

1045
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:13,560
colonizing the human population will not

1046
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:17,339
protect us from another one hmm it

1047
00:50:17,339 --> 00:50:20,130
sounds like good reason to do more

1048
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:22,440
research on the whole family of viruses

1049
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,280
right and and to that I would say we

1050
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:29,369
probably didn't learn enough from SARS

1051
00:50:29,369 --> 00:50:32,400
and MERS because we didn't have enough

1052
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,380
work going on or not surveillance in

1053
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:36,359
pathogenesis and so forth would you

1054
00:50:36,359 --> 00:50:39,390
agree with that I would SARS SARS came

1055
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:43,589
in and went so quickly that certainly

1056
00:50:43,589 --> 00:50:47,460
commercial interest dropped off at an

1057
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:48,420
exponential rate

1058
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:52,050
the virus emerged in 2002 caused 8,000

1059
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:54,180
cases in 2003 and four case

1060
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:57,630
in 2004 and then it was gone and so so

1061
00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:00,119
at the same time it of following that

1062
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:03,359
same arc that was the arc of commercial

1063
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:06,119
interest and it was also to some extent

1064
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:12,140
the arc of of NIH interest in developing

1065
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:16,980
vaccines and immunotherapy DEQ's for the

1066
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:19,230
shelf that could be used in in future

1067
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:22,559
outbreaks our own research has shown

1068
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:25,859
that there are SARS like bat strains

1069
00:51:25,859 --> 00:51:29,270
that vary by at least up to 22 percent

1070
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:32,279
probably up to 35 percent that are

1071
00:51:32,279 --> 00:51:34,619
poised to use the human receptors and

1072
00:51:34,619 --> 00:51:36,809
probably can grow really really

1073
00:51:36,809 --> 00:51:38,670
efficiently in primary human airway

1074
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:40,740
cells we know that for a fact with MERS

1075
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:43,500
there are two murders like viruses that

1076
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,380
differ by 35 percent it can use human

1077
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:49,500
dpp-4 receptors and grow to equal titers

1078
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:52,650
in primary human airway cells and also

1079
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:54,059
you it want to ask the question well

1080
00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:55,829
what's what are the biological features

1081
00:51:55,829 --> 00:51:58,170
and what's the transmissibility pattern

1082
00:51:58,170 --> 00:52:00,569
and how transmissible is this other

1083
00:52:00,569 --> 00:52:03,329
emerge like strain from china that is 35

1084
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:06,329
percent different is it a sarge - in the

1085
00:52:06,329 --> 00:52:08,490
making or is there something in between

1086
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:13,380
that that would be perfectly poised to

1087
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,680
cause a pandemic like SARS - and the

1088
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,420
answer is they're probably out there in

1089
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:20,910
nature and it's just a question of time

1090
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:25,740
between before human a human comes in

1091
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:29,760
contact with the bat that has sufficient

1092
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,829
titers to allow that individual to be

1093
00:52:31,829 --> 00:52:34,799
infected and then that individual go to

1094
00:52:34,799 --> 00:52:38,099
a location that allows for the spark to

1095
00:52:38,099 --> 00:52:41,130
start the fire of the next pandemic so

1096
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:45,539
even if you stop the sale of meat at

1097
00:52:45,539 --> 00:52:46,890
these markets there will still be

1098
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:49,740
contact with humans and bats so that's

1099
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:51,150
correct no it's not gonna this outbreak

1100
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:53,910
could have been caused by person living

1101
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:56,730
in rural China who came in contact with

1102
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:59,520
a bat in a bat cave either collecting

1103
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,340
guano or doing

1104
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:03,980
just by random chance with bats flying

1105
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:07,640
over and they went to Wuhan and they

1106
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,150
actually started the outbreak without

1107
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:12,530
without the seeding this thing through

1108
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:14,540
an open market setting in the bats by

1109
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:17,150
the way who are infected with SARS like

1110
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:19,970
an MERS like coronaviruses where is the

1111
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:23,150
virus replicating in them and does it

1112
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:25,420
cause any problems to them

1113
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:27,740
most of the data argues that it's an

1114
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:30,970
enteric pathogen hmm

1115
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:33,410
there haven't there have been there's

1116
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:37,910
been some work done on this by I believe

1117
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:40,160
lint fought Weng

1118
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,650
but in general there hasn't been much in

1119
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:45,770
the way of studying coronavirus

1120
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:48,080
replication and pathogenesis in in bat

1121
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,180
species and and to some extent that's

1122
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:51,680
driven by the fact that you have to have

1123
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,190
the right type of bat right to allow for

1124
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:58,430
infection so if it's an enteric virus

1125
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:01,280
and bats than any contact with guano

1126
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,070
could potentially spread it that's right

1127
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:07,310
and we know it's in guano because most

1128
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:08,990
of the collection is guano that's taken

1129
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:11,360
back to the laboratory right where the

1130
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,260
RNA is then extracted and then used for

1131
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:17,540
deep sequencing what's the status of

1132
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:19,460
vaccine development Ralph we may have

1133
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:22,520
discussed this in the past but where do

1134
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:25,580
we stand are there in particular are

1135
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:28,720
there reasonable candidates out there

1136
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,030
anything from SARS that have been in

1137
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:34,460
human trials and I'm also interested at

1138
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:37,810
the potential for complications from

1139
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:41,660
antigen dependent enhancements and that

1140
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:44,990
causing issues are with the vaccines so

1141
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:48,200
I think I think there are at least two

1142
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,790
major candidates that are moving forward

1143
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:54,140
rapidly towards phase 1 trials and one

1144
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:58,750
is an RNA based vaccine and the other is

1145
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:03,230
recombinant protein based vaccines the

1146
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:07,100
RNA based vaccines are known to induce a

1147
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:11,060
strong th1 immune response which is good

1148
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:15,170
because alum when alum was adjuvant

1149
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:18,290
with SARS coronavirus vaccine it induced

1150
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:20,930
a strong th2 immune response that was

1151
00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:22,700
associated with large amounts of immune

1152
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:25,610
pathology the characteristic cells

1153
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:27,500
aureus inner fills and neutrophils that

1154
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,420
are seen in especially eosinophils

1155
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:31,370
although the Ascenta fills are probably

1156
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:34,010
not doing the damage it's mostly

1157
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:37,160
cytokine based storms right and TNF

1158
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,960
alpha and other things I believe that

1159
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,890
are causing most of the tissue damage

1160
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:45,380
but if anybody would like to elaborate

1161
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:49,280
on that I would like to hear it so by an

1162
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,140
RNA based vaccine we're talking about

1163
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:53,720
essentially a messenger RNA encoding a

1164
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,210
spike protein that's delivered maybe as

1165
00:55:56,210 --> 00:55:58,220
an Olympic nanoparticle or something

1166
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:00,920
like a right okay so I don't know the

1167
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,800
actual formulation in terms of the in

1168
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:09,740
terms of the the delivery the delivery

1169
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:12,590
vehicle yes right that but that one is

1170
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:14,620
probably going to be first to market

1171
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:17,540
simply because of the the speed of

1172
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,700
production of that vaccine and that it's

1173
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:20,840
one of the reasons that's one of the

1174
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:23,090
ones early in trials is that they had

1175
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:24,680
this platform and all they had to do was

1176
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,750
plug in the sequence and and you know

1177
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,370
make a bunch of RNA and now they can go

1178
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:31,640
you know start start trials and that

1179
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,730
hopefully is where kind of vaccine

1180
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:37,820
research at least some of it is going in

1181
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:39,230
the long run anyway some sort of

1182
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:42,970
platforms that allow for rapid

1183
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:45,410
development of vaccines rather than

1184
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:47,540
having to mess around with these

1185
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:50,690
complicated viruses very much so right

1186
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:52,970
that's true and we are actually involved

1187
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:54,920
in some of those clinical trials okay

1188
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,200
you're using in terms of the prion

1189
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:01,250
pre-ind work done in animal models and

1190
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:02,870
it's fortunate to hear that they induce

1191
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:04,520
the th1 response that seems to be

1192
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,800
protective in this particular case

1193
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,380
that's right yes so there we have an

1194
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:11,120
email which will be later but it's from

1195
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:14,270
a person who knows about vaccines and

1196
00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:19,910
they say that if if this one is licensed

1197
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:23,450
in 18 months that would be a record yeah

1198
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:26,780
right that's correct but that's a kind

1199
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,110
of platform that

1200
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:29,400
be associated with that although that

1201
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,950
probably would not impact this current

1202
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:35,100
outbreak right Ralph I don't know the

1203
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:38,100
have not been engaged in the discussions

1204
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:40,110
about what the timeline for phase 1

1205
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:44,880
phase 2 and phase 3 testing are if I

1206
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,250
were involved in it I would probably be

1207
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:49,940
arguing that we need to have phase 1

1208
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:54,060
trials that are probably done in

1209
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:56,070
parallel with some of the animal testing

1210
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:59,730
and that we try to be positioned to do

1211
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:01,620
some type of phase 2 trial and

1212
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:06,170
populations by October November so that

1213
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:10,860
individuals will be an immune prior to

1214
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:15,810
the next round of infections hmm so how

1215
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:17,490
about the complication of antibody

1216
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:19,500
dependent enhancement I have heard that

1217
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:22,380
there have been some observations in

1218
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:27,680
animal models that this phenomenon of

1219
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:34,290
mmm poor immunity winding up enhancing a

1220
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:37,620
real infection something like it has

1221
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:40,050
been observed in animal models and that

1222
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:43,290
seems to me it could complicate the

1223
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:45,830
vaccine development recalling the

1224
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:49,110
respiratory syncytial virus vaccine that

1225
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:53,370
failed because it enhanced disease from

1226
00:58:53,370 --> 00:58:55,800
natural infection or the dengue vaccine

1227
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:59,100
or the dengue virus uh-huh the dengue

1228
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,170
vaccine is a good example of a de and

1229
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:03,930
the RSV vaccine I think was mostly th2

1230
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:08,610
driven immune pathology okay so the

1231
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:10,530
classic example in a corona virus with

1232
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:12,330
AD is feline infectious peritonitis

1233
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:16,410
virus and the FIP vaccines induce a

1234
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:20,400
antibody response that allows the the

1235
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,930
antibody coats the virus and allows for

1236
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:23,640
more efficient affection of macrophages

1237
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:26,010
and monocytes cell populations and this

1238
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:29,840
results in much more severe disease the

1239
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:34,380
the SARS data and SARS and data is much

1240
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:37,500
more controversial there are a couple of

1241
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:40,230
reports of people being able to use to

1242
00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:41,519
demonstrate antibody and

1243
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:44,909
asmin of an infection of monocytes or

1244
00:59:44,909 --> 00:59:48,499
reporter actually reporter cells it's

1245
00:59:48,499 --> 00:59:51,959
expressing FC receptors with various

1246
00:59:51,959 --> 00:59:54,539
antibodies in cell culture there's been

1247
00:59:54,539 --> 00:59:58,349
one report in primates of an ad e like

1248
00:59:58,349 --> 01:00:00,779
phenomena that was reported in china but

1249
01:00:00,779 --> 01:00:06,049
has not been replicated anywhere and so

1250
01:00:06,049 --> 01:00:12,089
the community i would have in general

1251
01:00:12,089 --> 01:00:15,779
the community's speculative is the ad e

1252
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:17,759
phenomenon is more speculative and

1253
01:00:17,759 --> 01:00:20,880
probably controversial okay having said

1254
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,009
that they clearly have to look for it

1255
01:00:23,009 --> 01:00:27,059
yeah right okay so so that's one of

1256
01:00:27,059 --> 01:00:28,469
those things that you might look for in

1257
01:00:28,469 --> 01:00:31,409
animal models you know we have good

1258
01:00:31,409 --> 01:00:34,519
animal models for this viral infection

1259
01:00:34,519 --> 01:00:37,229
right now the only real animal model is

1260
01:00:37,229 --> 01:00:40,909
a human ace two transgenic mouse

1261
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:43,109
they were made in probably three

1262
01:00:43,109 --> 01:00:45,329
laboratories for laboratories around the

1263
01:00:45,329 --> 01:00:49,380
world back around 2004 to 2006 most were

1264
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:54,119
cry were preserved they were the the ace

1265
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:59,219
two molecule was either Express from CMV

1266
01:00:59,219 --> 01:01:01,409
promoter or tissue specific lung

1267
01:01:01,409 --> 01:01:05,209
promoters didn't really matter too much

1268
01:01:05,209 --> 01:01:08,839
the consequences of this were the same

1269
01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:11,249
the virus would replicate in the lung

1270
01:01:11,249 --> 01:01:13,319
and around day six it goes to the brain

1271
01:01:13,319 --> 01:01:17,549
and causes a fatal encephalitis so we

1272
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:22,859
have one of those models we had sent it

1273
01:01:22,859 --> 01:01:26,579
a couple years back to a group of

1274
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:28,709
investigators in at the Institute of

1275
01:01:28,709 --> 01:01:31,709
ayala G in Wuhan and they have a paper

1276
01:01:31,709 --> 01:01:34,289
that they've just recently submitted on

1277
01:01:34,289 --> 01:01:38,479
this model that I'm also an author on so

1278
01:01:38,479 --> 01:01:41,359
that model of that paper is under review

1279
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:44,399
so remember with SARS you had to mouse

1280
01:01:44,399 --> 01:01:46,529
adapt the virus to infect those

1281
01:01:46,529 --> 01:01:48,329
transgenics is that correct that's

1282
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:48,989
correct

1283
01:01:48,989 --> 01:01:51,809
same with SARS Co v2 with SARS to will

1284
01:01:51,809 --> 01:01:53,579
not replicate in mice we've tried

1285
01:01:53,579 --> 01:01:54,740
collaborative cross

1286
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:57,290
I mean a deficient mice wild-type

1287
01:01:57,290 --> 01:02:00,730
regular laboratory mice mmm

1288
01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:03,850
if you look at the interface of the

1289
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:06,350
receptor binding domain of this virus to

1290
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:10,400
its receptor there are specific residues

1291
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,250
that would be predicted to convert the

1292
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:16,160
SARS to strain to a mouse adapted

1293
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:19,420
strains using the worst genetics I

1294
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:21,619
remember when the first paper came out

1295
01:02:21,619 --> 01:02:24,080
of the Wuhan lab they had a bunch of

1296
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,970
cells where they had put in human ace 2

1297
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:28,250
and the mouse cells that did not

1298
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:29,960
replicate that's correct

1299
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:32,930
and human and the bat and some others

1300
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:36,020
did so I set up problem for a transgenic

1301
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:39,380
model right yeah right so I know that

1302
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:41,930
some groups are developing knock ins

1303
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:47,810
mm-hmm were probably we are approaches

1304
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:50,690
to use the existing human HT transgenic

1305
01:02:50,690 --> 01:02:53,290
mouse model in the lab as well as

1306
01:02:53,290 --> 01:02:55,400
working towards Mouse adapted strains

1307
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:58,190
all right it's been an hour Ralph and

1308
01:02:58,190 --> 01:03:01,550
any quick questions from anyone before

1309
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:05,119
we say goodbye all right really

1310
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:06,650
appreciate it Ralph that's this was

1311
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:11,690
awesome awesome so much thank you you're

1312
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:13,220
all being very generous just a pleasure

1313
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:16,280
to talk with you all and you have a

1314
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:20,240
great weekend and stay safe and support

1315
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:24,050
your local efforts at implementing

1316
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,330
Public Health a barrier approaches to

1317
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:28,700
prevent the spread of the disease yeah

1318
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:30,710
good point and rally doing it will you

1319
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:33,470
come back again oh sure I will do I'll

1320
01:03:33,470 --> 01:03:35,840
be glad to okay thanks a lot ruff okay

1321
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:40,000
thank you so much

1322
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:46,130
wow I'm blown away I I'm still thinking

1323
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:48,320
about what he said about establishment

1324
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,000
potentially in some other animal

1325
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,780
reservoir spill really got me no better

1326
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:58,730
no better yeah very interesting but we

1327
01:03:58,730 --> 01:04:01,630
have other issues right now right yes

1328
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:05,420
other coronavirus issues it's it mean in

1329
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:07,160
the u.s. is just getting started really

1330
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:08,390
right so

1331
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:10,970
we have a ways to go all right and we

1332
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:12,200
have a lot of email but I wanted to

1333
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:15,160
touch on just a few things very briefly

1334
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:18,290
first is there is a paper submitted to

1335
01:04:18,290 --> 01:04:20,180
New England Journal you can find it on

1336
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:23,900
med archive so we have bio archive and

1337
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:26,600
med archive another place to check but

1338
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,690
that's fine and it's all about the how

1339
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:32,870
long infectivity lasts in various

1340
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:35,510
situations this comes out of Rocky

1341
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:37,670
Mountain labs Vincent monster's group

1342
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:42,050
and also people at Princeton and UCLA so

1343
01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:44,030
they looked at Tsarskoe v2 and Tsarskoe

1344
01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:46,790
v1 and they measure infectious virus and

1345
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:50,180
they look at both detection limits and

1346
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:53,150
half-lives in aerosols and these are all

1347
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:54,860
generated in the laboratory so it's an

1348
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:56,540
artificial aerosol I don't know how fine

1349
01:04:56,540 --> 01:04:59,750
the particles are but you know they

1350
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:02,360
mentioned it briefly in the methods yeah

1351
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:04,640
I spent some time looking at the methods

1352
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:06,850
and they mentioned something about

1353
01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:09,770
particle sizes but they also talked

1354
01:05:09,770 --> 01:05:11,840
about how it was made in a Goldberg drum

1355
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,250
and I don't couldn't figure out what a

1356
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:17,870
Goldberg drum Rice all right well they

1357
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:19,730
make an aerosol or they put the virus on

1358
01:05:19,730 --> 01:05:21,950
various surfaces like copper cardboard

1359
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:24,950
steel and plastic and they say what's

1360
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:27,020
the half-life of infectivity what's the

1361
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:29,930
detection limit and I was talking to a

1362
01:05:29,930 --> 01:05:31,610
reporter this morning and I gave her all

1363
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:33,410
these numbers and she said that doesn't

1364
01:05:33,410 --> 01:05:35,390
mean anything to me what's the bottom

1365
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:36,250
line

1366
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:39,230
bottom line is it lasts long enough that

1367
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:41,750
transmitted an aerosol or on surfaces

1368
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:43,550
yes mm-hmm

1369
01:05:43,550 --> 01:05:45,170
that's the bomb and it lasts it lasts

1370
01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:47,120
longer on some surfaces than on others

1371
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:49,190
it seems to last longest on plastic and

1372
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:53,030
steel not quite as long on cardboard not

1373
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:54,980
forget long on copper and only a few

1374
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:59,540
hours as an aerosol yeah not

1375
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:01,850
indefinitely no this is all it's the

1376
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:03,770
drops below the detection limit after

1377
01:06:03,770 --> 01:06:06,770
the longest was 72 hours on plastic

1378
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:10,130
right yeah and and it was interesting

1379
01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:12,590
they compared since they're comparing

1380
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:17,450
new cyrus to classics ours here the new

1381
01:06:17,450 --> 01:06:19,970
czars last longer on in most of these

1382
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:22,080
assays

1383
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:24,360
speaking peace speaking of classic stars

1384
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:26,550
that kind of reminds me of classic rock

1385
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:29,580
right you know my wife told me now my

1386
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:32,220
wife listens to Sirius and that there's

1387
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:36,120
a coronavirus channel on Sirius XM play

1388
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,550
they don't play they talk for all time

1389
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:41,160
okay they just play interviews with

1390
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,950
people they should play on there I know

1391
01:06:43,950 --> 01:06:45,990
they don't want us but well they I don't

1392
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:47,160
know if they want to sign up but they

1393
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:49,590
should in fact you know Columbia radio

1394
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:52,160
station should be playing Twitter 24/7

1395
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:55,530
right I think that that last hour with

1396
01:06:55,530 --> 01:06:57,390
Ralph is probably the most informative

1397
01:06:57,390 --> 01:06:58,890
thing we've ever done that was

1398
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:01,680
incredibly that was then I think that

1399
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,690
with Daniel Griffin last week on the

1400
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:07,080
clinical ass deals with stuff that we

1401
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:08,760
don't know anything about yeah I would

1402
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,280
say that this past hour with Ralph the

1403
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,050
episode with Daniel and the previous

1404
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:15,030
episode with Ralph are where I feel like

1405
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:19,440
I've learned most of what I know yes so

1406
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,790
with Ralph so I think we should ran

1407
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:26,400
father Claus even as a grandfather so

1408
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,440
one of the things that just as an aside

1409
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:31,350
interests me about this stability paper

1410
01:07:31,350 --> 01:07:32,910
and this is a phenomenon that's been

1411
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:34,920
known for sometimes why they test it is

1412
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:38,430
that things don't like pathogens don't

1413
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:40,740
like Connor right that's right it

1414
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:42,630
wouldn't it would make sense to make

1415
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:44,910
everything in hospitals out of copper

1416
01:07:44,910 --> 01:07:48,030
out of copper at least high-traffic

1417
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:49,920
things like bed rails and doorknobs and

1418
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,500
that's what Michael Schmitt is doing he

1419
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,780
does clinical trials to assess the

1420
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,430
effect of lining these surfaces and

1421
01:07:56,430 --> 01:07:57,870
hospitals on copper and it certainly

1422
01:07:57,870 --> 01:08:00,810
brings down hospital-acquired infections

1423
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:03,950
we did yesterday on twit a paper

1424
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:06,120
published a couple of years ago on

1425
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:09,560
coronavirus two to ninety one of these

1426
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:13,190
Coronas that caused common colds and on

1427
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:16,560
copper the infectivity is lost like in

1428
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,529
seconds when you put it on it when it's

1429
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:21,450
mixed with mucus I think it really in

1430
01:08:21,450 --> 01:08:23,700
activates it and so it's quite

1431
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:27,839
antimicrobial and anti viral so so just

1432
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:30,210
make your clothes out of copper right

1433
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:32,660
just go out at the cop of armor and

1434
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:34,890
there you go

1435
01:08:34,890 --> 01:08:35,880
so then

1436
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,439
is the nice paper in The Lancet that I

1437
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:40,229
saw this this week where they studied a

1438
01:08:40,229 --> 01:08:43,380
number of cases in China and they said

1439
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:45,689
what are the biggest comorbidity risks

1440
01:08:45,689 --> 01:08:49,170
for getting very serious disease and the

1441
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:50,488
biggest risks risks are hypertension

1442
01:08:50,488 --> 01:08:52,698
diabetes and coronary heart disease

1443
01:08:52,698 --> 01:08:54,960
which is like half the American

1444
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:59,639
population exactly and so China the

1445
01:08:59,639 --> 01:09:01,770
patients who died typically or had the

1446
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:03,359
most serious disease had those issues

1447
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,969
and I think for me that's the driving

1448
01:09:05,969 --> 01:09:08,069
issue right now not that there'll be a

1449
01:09:08,069 --> 01:09:10,020
lot of infections because as ralph said

1450
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:12,270
83% of them are mild but the most

1451
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:15,179
serious ones need hospitalization and we

1452
01:09:15,179 --> 01:09:18,270
don't have enough ICU beds to take care

1453
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:19,589
of people if we suddenly get millions

1454
01:09:19,589 --> 01:09:21,719
and millions of cases right right well

1455
01:09:21,719 --> 01:09:23,488
and that's the logic of canceling

1456
01:09:23,488 --> 01:09:25,889
everything because if we can yeah yeah

1457
01:09:25,889 --> 01:09:28,139
it may be that everybody is eventually

1458
01:09:28,139 --> 01:09:29,279
going to get exposed to this or at

1459
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:30,448
seventy percent of the populations

1460
01:09:30,448 --> 01:09:32,580
eventually gonna get exposed but if that

1461
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:36,238
happens next week then we're gonna have

1462
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:37,979
a problem if that happens over a period

1463
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:40,439
of a couple of months yeah exactly then

1464
01:09:40,439 --> 01:09:43,170
it's gonna be a slower trickle of people

1465
01:09:43,170 --> 01:09:44,819
going into the hospital and by the time

1466
01:09:44,819 --> 01:09:46,408
they need the bed it's emptied out from

1467
01:09:46,408 --> 01:09:47,880
the previous person and they'll be able

1468
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:50,939
to handle the capacity so that's trying

1469
01:09:50,939 --> 01:09:53,339
to slow it down is a big emphasis now

1470
01:09:53,339 --> 01:09:54,719
yes exactly

1471
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:59,010
hashtag flatten the curve yes and then

1472
01:09:59,010 --> 01:10:00,560
there was a Lancet article this week

1473
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:03,420
maybe today out of Italy where they

1474
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:06,780
predict 30,000 cases next week and that

1475
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:09,719
will completely saturate their ICU bed

1476
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:14,010
capacity which they'd never seen 15,000

1477
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:16,380
113 right now I'm looking at the Johns

1478
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:18,750
Hopkins site so just have to double it

1479
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:21,420
and that's why the mortality rate is so

1480
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:23,219
high if you can't handle the patients

1481
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:25,830
they will die right and yeah if you can

1482
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:28,320
give them good health care just like the

1483
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,150
Ebola outbreak right when they came to

1484
01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:32,639
the US they survived it's a similar

1485
01:10:32,639 --> 01:10:36,030
situation so Italy Italy is reputed to

1486
01:10:36,030 --> 01:10:38,159
have a pretty good health care system

1487
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:40,020
they do they're getting overwhelmed but

1488
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:41,790
they don't have enough ICU beds as I

1489
01:10:41,790 --> 01:10:45,060
said we have 95,000 here in the US and

1490
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:49,380
you know that's 10 million cases would

1491
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:50,100
saturate

1492
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:52,020
right am i doing if they were 1% I think

1493
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:54,330
that's right yeah I think so all right

1494
01:10:54,330 --> 01:10:57,780
you want to do some email sure sure

1495
01:10:57,780 --> 01:11:00,360
all right so I'll just take Ann's who

1496
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:02,130
writes a link to a link to the

1497
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:05,400
comprehensive info about kovat 19 our

1498
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:07,080
world and data yes this is a very nice

1499
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:10,350
site with lovely statistics of all sorts

1500
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:12,810
of things not just Covey's 19 I use it

1501
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:15,330
for polio and HIV and AIDS and so forth

1502
01:11:15,330 --> 01:11:18,330
so that's really nice and and then I'll

1503
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:20,340
take Volkers here are my current

1504
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:22,140
questions not yet answered by your

1505
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:25,220
incredible useful service to the public

1506
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:27,300
pretty early in the year was mentioned

1507
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:28,890
that retrospective analysis that

1508
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:30,720
identified a kovat case not linked to

1509
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,970
the fish market oh so any updates about

1510
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:34,800
where the virus came from is it the fish

1511
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,880
market so Ralph said we don't know right

1512
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:42,480
we yeah it may not have been from the

1513
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,670
fish market it may have gone into the

1514
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:46,650
fish market and then spread there and

1515
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:48,870
Ralph outlined the scenario that was

1516
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:50,430
very realistic of somebody in rural

1517
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:52,320
China catching this directly from a bat

1518
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,930
and then going to Wuhan and bringing it

1519
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:57,690
there and I mean maybe it was even a

1520
01:11:57,690 --> 01:12:00,270
farmer at the market who you know then

1521
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:01,800
went in and spread it to people at the

1522
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:06,300
market we just we don't know the the

1523
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:07,950
data that was meant that this person

1524
01:12:07,950 --> 01:12:09,540
mentions about the retrospective

1525
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:12,210
analysis about a case in early December

1526
01:12:12,210 --> 01:12:13,680
not connected to the fish market is

1527
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:15,420
still the data that I reference yeah

1528
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:18,780
we're talking about this they said how

1529
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:20,190
do you interpret the evolution in China

1530
01:12:20,190 --> 01:12:21,840
is there already an effect of herd

1531
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:24,450
immunity due to earlier spread and I

1532
01:12:24,450 --> 01:12:26,850
would say we don't know as as ralph said

1533
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:28,650
because they're only reporting in the

1534
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:31,410
quarantine zones so we don't know what's

1535
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:33,120
going on elsewhere right now there are

1536
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,340
just like ten or less cases a day in

1537
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:39,090
China and reported reported hoarded and

1538
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:41,220
apparently they're resuming slowly life

1539
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:44,340
isn't usual if there isn't a lot of herd

1540
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:45,720
immunity there will be another outbreak

1541
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:49,310
I would think so

1542
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:51,440
he said could you cover the effects of

1543
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:54,400
potentially overwhelmed health systems

1544
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:58,250
well we are not experts about that but

1545
01:12:58,250 --> 01:12:59,930
yes that's a problem and that's the main

1546
01:12:59,930 --> 01:13:01,520
concern right now which has happened

1547
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,110
which happened in Wuhan early on which

1548
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:06,080
happened in Italy and Iran and contrast

1549
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,120
to South Korea

1550
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:11,480
yeah the fatality is less than 1% and

1551
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:13,699
probably a big part of South Korea's

1552
01:13:13,699 --> 01:13:15,290
success was that they took it very

1553
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:18,170
seriously very early and implemented

1554
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:20,750
implemented the the sort of self

1555
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:22,850
quarantine social distancing type of

1556
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:26,750
protocols immediately and they they

1557
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:28,940
weren't I gather being a democracy they

1558
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:30,800
weren't quite as draconian about it as

1559
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:33,250
China was but they were they were

1560
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:35,989
proactive and got on top of things early

1561
01:13:35,989 --> 01:13:39,020
and that gave them a flatter curve that

1562
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:41,090
allowed them to deal with what was

1563
01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:42,170
happening and also they have an

1564
01:13:42,170 --> 01:13:44,780
excellent health care system situation

1565
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:46,280
in Munich far too warm for mid March

1566
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:48,050
schools will be closed from next Monday

1567
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:50,140
companies are training or already

1568
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:52,489
implementing emergency plans in the

1569
01:13:52,489 --> 01:13:54,070
shops you missed three things

1570
01:13:54,070 --> 01:14:02,239
disinfectants noodles toilet paper paper

1571
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:04,489
- oh we are actually out of all three of

1572
01:14:04,489 --> 01:14:06,860
those things in our own supermarket here

1573
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:09,130
in New Jersey that's exactly the same

1574
01:14:09,130 --> 01:14:10,460
staple

1575
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:12,920
I think it's because it's a quick meal

1576
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:17,540
that also is gonna keep well yeah okay

1577
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:19,670
Alan can you take the next one

1578
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:22,400
sure Josh writes dear Twitter's I've

1579
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:23,780
been enjoying a recent coverage of the

1580
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:25,370
corona virus and wanted to ask question

1581
01:14:25,370 --> 01:14:27,560
is it possible this corona virus has

1582
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:29,390
been in circulation in the US for a time

1583
01:14:29,390 --> 01:14:31,580
already and we're not only now seeing

1584
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:33,080
cases because we're testing for them

1585
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:35,090
when we were not beforehand please

1586
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:36,560
forgive this question is been asked

1587
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,270
previously please forgive us this that

1588
01:14:38,270 --> 01:14:44,000
asked previously and I can guarantee

1589
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,160
that it was here before we started

1590
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:49,430
getting positive deaths i given given

1591
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:51,080
the rate at which testing was being done

1592
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:56,449
early on in the US and the the the risk

1593
01:14:56,449 --> 01:14:59,810
the testing response by I'm sorry I'm I

1594
01:14:59,810 --> 01:15:01,699
know we have listeners at the CDC and

1595
01:15:01,699 --> 01:15:02,960
there are a lot of good people there

1596
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:03,610
doing there

1597
01:15:03,610 --> 01:15:07,810
but the CDC testing early and this was

1598
01:15:07,810 --> 01:15:12,460
just just not up to snuff and first the

1599
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:14,350
infection was Washington in January

1600
01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:16,780
right the US yeah I think so yeah

1601
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:18,460
there there's been some data where

1602
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:19,990
people have looked at the sequence of

1603
01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:21,610
virus from some of the patients in

1604
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:24,100
Washington and tried to determine how

1605
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:26,290
long the virus was circulating how many

1606
01:15:26,290 --> 01:15:29,620
differences had happened and it looked

1607
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:31,330
like the virus had been there about six

1608
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:34,720
weeks at that point right for sure yeah

1609
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:37,750
so it was it was here well before we

1610
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:40,690
knew it and we have not handled this

1611
01:15:40,690 --> 01:15:45,910
well at all as as a country and then

1612
01:15:45,910 --> 01:15:48,040
Josh Peters is on a lighter note I told

1613
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:49,570
my colleagues that I was going to quit

1614
01:15:49,570 --> 01:15:51,400
my job and follow a twig on their tour

1615
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,770
around the world they just said what's

1616
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:59,440
twig and that's part of the problem have

1617
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,990
a failure to communicate but the 12 tour

1618
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:04,300
around the world has been postponed yes

1619
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:07,840
no we're not having this for sure was

1620
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:10,390
that gonna ask we're still not testing

1621
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:13,660
enough right now or not or not I mean

1622
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:15,460
states are starting to take over so here

1623
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:18,040
our governor has implemented and gotten

1624
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:21,640
testing by private companies and as I

1625
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:23,200
said he's the we're starting drive

1626
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,540
through testings here that's great so

1627
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:26,770
basically if you're a state you should

1628
01:16:26,770 --> 01:16:27,760
do it on your own because you're not

1629
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:30,490
getting federal guidance sadly yeah

1630
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:32,110
Brianne can you take the next one

1631
01:16:32,110 --> 01:16:36,040
sure Cindy writes along with being a

1632
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:38,620
longtime Twix lover I'm a police officer

1633
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:40,600
in a small New England town our

1634
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:43,150
resources aren't as sophisticated as I

1635
01:16:43,150 --> 01:16:45,190
would imagine population centers are I'm

1636
01:16:45,190 --> 01:16:47,770
usually the only officer in my town when

1637
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:49,540
I'm working and I get dispatched to

1638
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:53,320
every emergency medical call for a

1639
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:55,390
typical emergency say heart attack I

1640
01:16:55,390 --> 01:16:57,430
would get radioed about the situation at

1641
01:16:57,430 --> 01:16:59,140
the same time as Fire and Rescue and

1642
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:01,960
we'll drive right there the on-call EMTs

1643
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:03,490
would drive to the fire station get

1644
01:17:03,490 --> 01:17:05,530
their gear and the ambulance and drive

1645
01:17:05,530 --> 01:17:08,350
to the call I arrived alone to the

1646
01:17:08,350 --> 01:17:10,540
medical call usually 10 to 15 minutes

1647
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:13,420
prior to them I carry a small oxygen

1648
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:16,060
tank with that bag-valve-mask

1649
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:17,510
nasal cannula

1650
01:17:17,510 --> 01:17:21,020
non-rebreather an AED a few tourniquets

1651
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:24,500
and some narcan PPE is non latex gloves

1652
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:34,280
and a glock 22 that's good I'm only a

1653
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:36,140
couple of years on the job but doing

1654
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:38,120
chest compressions already resulted in a

1655
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:40,190
save for me along with multiple times I

1656
01:17:40,190 --> 01:17:41,570
kept people with oh boy

1657
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:44,240
opioid overdoses breathing until medical

1658
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:49,010
arrived good job I've also provided care

1659
01:17:49,010 --> 01:17:50,960
to young and old dying people who

1660
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:53,930
probably had contagious disease I'm left

1661
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:56,000
to do my best and maybe use some hand

1662
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,680
sanitizer before I get back in my

1663
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:00,230
cruiser I don't even have access to a

1664
01:18:00,230 --> 01:18:02,150
clothes washer at the police department

1665
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:03,770
so uniforms are coming home to get

1666
01:18:03,770 --> 01:18:08,120
washed in an ideal world all smaller

1667
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:09,920
police departments would be prepared for

1668
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,890
this outbreak but we certainly are not

1669
01:18:11,890 --> 01:18:14,960
what should I plan for as far as calls I

1670
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:17,120
can imagine a lot of struggling to

1671
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:19,730
breathe and non-responsive or with a

1672
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:22,790
pulse patients other than being

1673
01:18:22,790 --> 01:18:24,860
completely horrified by my situation is

1674
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:26,720
there anything you can recommend I do to

1675
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:28,850
protect myself to protect the next

1676
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:32,030
person I go help am I wrong to be kind

1677
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:33,560
of resigned to the idea that I will be

1678
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:35,090
exposed and we'll just have to deal with

1679
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:37,100
that and try not to be a source myself

1680
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:40,610
thanks Cindy just a brief personal

1681
01:18:40,610 --> 01:18:42,470
perspective here my sister is a

1682
01:18:42,470 --> 01:18:45,940
paramedic in New Bedford Massachusetts

1683
01:18:45,940 --> 01:18:48,590
and my wife by the way is working in an

1684
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:50,870
emergency room in Connecticut now as a

1685
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:55,760
doctor but I my first suggestion would

1686
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:58,820
be to talk to the EMTs and see if you

1687
01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:01,970
can borrow some extra gloves and maybe

1688
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:05,230
maybe masks from them if they have them

1689
01:19:05,230 --> 01:19:08,230
although those are in real short supply

1690
01:19:08,230 --> 01:19:13,370
and and do the best you can I don't

1691
01:19:13,370 --> 01:19:15,290
think you're wrong to be resigned to the

1692
01:19:15,290 --> 01:19:17,870
idea that you'll get exposed yeah I

1693
01:19:17,870 --> 01:19:24,130
think as a frontline first responder I

1694
01:19:24,130 --> 01:19:28,040
I'm sorry that's it's gonna happen so

1695
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:30,110
yeah your your best protection is going

1696
01:19:30,110 --> 01:19:31,310
to be immunity in the law

1697
01:19:31,310 --> 01:19:33,650
yeah so she shouldn't be wearing a

1698
01:19:33,650 --> 01:19:39,920
facemask you think I I think if

1699
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:43,580
available maybe she should I because

1700
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:45,230
she's a first responder if she's gonna

1701
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:48,350
be right down there with the aerosol can

1702
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:50,960
be right down there with them and you

1703
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,150
know running into into these situations

1704
01:19:53,150 --> 01:19:57,080
where she's got the right PPE for a

1705
01:19:57,080 --> 01:20:01,630
police officer I'm glad to hear that but

1706
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:04,420
yeah you know do what you can to avoid

1707
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:07,790
getting coughed on I mean that sounds

1708
01:20:07,790 --> 01:20:08,990
kind of silly if you're gonna be

1709
01:20:08,990 --> 01:20:10,670
performing CPR and somebody you do what

1710
01:20:10,670 --> 01:20:12,640
you can

1711
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:15,560
young and probably won't have a serious

1712
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:16,010
infection

1713
01:20:16,010 --> 01:20:18,200
yeah if you're if you're you know you're

1714
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,240
young you're you're police officer so

1715
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:22,070
you've met the physical standards for

1716
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:25,220
that you probably will not have an issue

1717
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:27,950
with this but I applaud your concern

1718
01:20:27,950 --> 01:20:30,170
about exposing the next person you

1719
01:20:30,170 --> 01:20:32,750
respond to which is a very appropriate

1720
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:35,510
and valid concern I think under the

1721
01:20:35,510 --> 01:20:37,760
circumstances there's probably not a lot

1722
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,500
to be done that you're not already doing

1723
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:42,080
if we have anyone listening who knows

1724
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:44,150
who works in this area please let us

1725
01:20:44,150 --> 01:20:47,870
know yes I wouldn't taste I was would

1726
01:20:47,870 --> 01:20:50,000
just say Cindy thank you for all that

1727
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,430
you're doing yes and I'm sorry that I

1728
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:54,230
don't have something we don't have

1729
01:20:54,230 --> 01:20:57,110
something sort of fabulous to tell you

1730
01:20:57,110 --> 01:21:01,190
here yeah I love that we that we've got

1731
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:03,440
a police officer in a small lowing in

1732
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:03,920
town

1733
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:06,080
listening to whiff I just think that's

1734
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:08,960
great and the image I have in my mind it

1735
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:17,390
won't go away as far go yes maybe she's

1736
01:21:17,390 --> 01:21:21,020
in your town Allen who knows yeah you're

1737
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:22,700
a small New England town right we're a

1738
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:24,680
small New England town that's that's my

1739
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,810
kind of place Nixon can you take the

1740
01:21:26,810 --> 01:21:29,960
next one I'd be happy to Nicolas writes

1741
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:34,040
dear twisters my name is Nicolas vestan

1742
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:34,610
Heine

1743
01:21:34,610 --> 01:21:37,790
I am a GP from southern Germany and the

1744
01:21:37,790 --> 01:21:39,710
corona virus pandemic brought me to your

1745
01:21:39,710 --> 01:21:42,890
podcast at first I want to thank you it

1746
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:44,280
is a pleasure to listen to

1747
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:47,130
we're gonna work by bicycle every twice

1748
01:21:47,130 --> 01:21:49,380
a day and so I have about 40 minutes of

1749
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:50,970
time to listen to all this important

1750
01:21:50,970 --> 01:21:53,040
information by the way we have about

1751
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:54,840
five degrees Celsius and mostly cloudy

1752
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,300
weather conditions my question is about

1753
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:59,670
the testing procedure I don't really

1754
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:02,310
know how this rt-pcr thing works and

1755
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:05,040
today I got a text which said that it is

1756
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,600
possible there is a lot of false

1757
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:09,420
positive tests now in Italy in Germany

1758
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:11,820
in this text they speculate that all

1759
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:13,530
these tests do not use a specific

1760
01:22:13,530 --> 01:22:16,920
Tsarskoe v2 tests get but a more general

1761
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:20,700
coronavirus test kit for this rt-pcr the

1762
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:22,980
conjecture is that it is not possible to

1763
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:26,180
produce so many specific test kits for

1764
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:29,430
Tsarskoe v2 in such a short time what do

1765
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:31,620
you think about this thanks and keep on

1766
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:37,710
twitting I think you can make a lot of

1767
01:22:37,710 --> 01:22:40,290
test kits it's not a priori Nia's great

1768
01:22:40,290 --> 01:22:42,390
tech you could definitely do that

1769
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:44,700
where we can do it we can do it why

1770
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:46,770
don't we do it I didn't say we can't do

1771
01:22:46,770 --> 01:22:49,770
it i we don't do it there was a rather

1772
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:52,410
disturbing NPR investigative report that

1773
01:22:52,410 --> 01:22:54,360
suggested at one explanation but I won't

1774
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:55,680
get into it goes will be accused of

1775
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:59,280
getting political all right I would say

1776
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:02,040
that Nicolas while there might be some

1777
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:04,500
questions of some things being in short

1778
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,480
supply those things are not what would

1779
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,340
tell you the difference between Tsarskoe

1780
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:11,640
v2 and other corona viruses the parts

1781
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,860
that are specific for Tsarskoe v2 are

1782
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:16,320
pretty easy to make in large quantities

1783
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:19,050
can make yes so if you go to the WHI

1784
01:23:19,050 --> 01:23:21,300
website they have all suggested primers

1785
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:23,520
and they're certainly pan corona primers

1786
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,580
and Tsarskoe v2 specific right so yeah

1787
01:23:26,580 --> 01:23:27,750
that's where you should be using now

1788
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:29,160
because otherwise you're not going to

1789
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:32,240
get the information you need

1790
01:23:34,430 --> 01:23:37,440
sorry go ahead it would be unusual to

1791
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:40,320
find another Co V circulating through

1792
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:41,880
those two countries and nowhere else

1793
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:44,100
I think there's I think there's the

1794
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:46,020
seasonal ones that Ralph's the seasonal

1795
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:48,930
regular coronaviruses right but I don't

1796
01:23:48,930 --> 01:23:50,760
know why anybody would be producing

1797
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:52,770
regular coronavirus test kits who's

1798
01:23:52,770 --> 01:23:56,480
capable of producing corona

1799
01:23:57,629 --> 01:23:59,249
our emphasis is gonna be on this and the

1800
01:23:59,249 --> 01:24:02,519
primers are the there's sort of the the

1801
01:24:02,519 --> 01:24:04,499
active ingredient in a PCR test they're

1802
01:24:04,499 --> 01:24:06,629
going to they're going to find the

1803
01:24:06,629 --> 01:24:08,070
specific sequence that you're looking

1804
01:24:08,070 --> 01:24:11,699
for so it is possible that somebody dug

1805
01:24:11,699 --> 01:24:14,359
out some old kits and use them it's

1806
01:24:14,359 --> 01:24:16,739
exceedingly unlikely especially in a

1807
01:24:16,739 --> 01:24:19,289
country like Germany or in Italy that

1808
01:24:19,289 --> 01:24:21,840
any significant number of those is

1809
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,909
generating large numbers of false

1810
01:24:23,909 --> 01:24:25,439
positives and somehow skewing the

1811
01:24:25,439 --> 01:24:28,229
statistics right right seem believable

1812
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:30,719
the the you know for the Caleb's out

1813
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:35,939
there the rt-pcr test is in maybe the

1814
01:24:35,939 --> 01:24:38,010
simplest explanation I can give is it's

1815
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:42,179
a way of asking whether the RNA sequence

1816
01:24:42,179 --> 01:24:46,409
that is diagnostic of this particular

1817
01:24:46,409 --> 01:24:49,320
virus is present in a sample and the way

1818
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:51,889
that's the critical reagent for that is

1819
01:24:51,889 --> 01:24:55,079
is the RNA sequence itself that's there

1820
01:24:55,079 --> 01:24:57,840
for the purpose of comparison saying the

1821
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,699
kit has the RNA sequence in there

1822
01:24:59,699 --> 01:25:03,119
effectively and says let's compare this

1823
01:25:03,119 --> 01:25:04,769
to this sample and see if it's there

1824
01:25:04,769 --> 01:25:06,899
it's obviously a lot more complicated

1825
01:25:06,899 --> 01:25:10,739
than that but it's not that's that's it

1826
01:25:10,739 --> 01:25:13,519
in theory and it's a very very common

1827
01:25:13,519 --> 01:25:17,340
procedure so if you got the kit and a

1828
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:18,840
minimal amount of training you ought to

1829
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:20,939
be able to run the run the test which

1830
01:25:20,939 --> 01:25:23,459
can take the next one Brenner writes hi

1831
01:25:23,459 --> 01:25:25,649
12 team long time listener

1832
01:25:25,649 --> 01:25:27,959
I started in academics after a PhD in a

1833
01:25:27,959 --> 01:25:30,899
postdoc I went into public health I hear

1834
01:25:30,899 --> 01:25:32,939
in the podcast that there isn't much

1835
01:25:32,939 --> 01:25:35,969
information on the current covet 19 or

1836
01:25:35,969 --> 01:25:40,260
as I prefer to call it SARS 2 Co V test

1837
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:42,989
so let me give you the background oh my

1838
01:25:42,989 --> 01:25:45,300
goodness I could have shut up

1839
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:48,030
the CBC originally came out with a

1840
01:25:48,030 --> 01:25:51,269
real-time reverse transcription PCR RT

1841
01:25:51,269 --> 01:25:55,739
RT PCR it had three targets all in the

1842
01:25:55,739 --> 01:25:59,820
end gene why the end gene when everybody

1843
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:02,429
else uses spike your guess is as good as

1844
01:26:02,429 --> 01:26:06,059
mine and she gives a link they sent out

1845
01:26:06,059 --> 01:26:07,860
and

1846
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:10,200
they sent the test out to 99 different

1847
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:15,210
public health labs of the 99 only five

1848
01:26:15,210 --> 01:26:17,940
could make the assay work ninety-four

1849
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:23,520
labs could have could have had the n3

1850
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:26,790
probe could have the n3 probe react to

1851
01:26:26,790 --> 01:26:31,830
something in the HSC late in the

1852
01:26:31,830 --> 01:26:35,430
reaction causing a late positive CT for

1853
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:37,920
the HSC probe - that's getting a little

1854
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:45,030
dense but basically they got tests

1855
01:26:45,030 --> 01:26:48,230
didn't work the CDC said they were gonna

1856
01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:51,360
false positives CDC said that they were

1857
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:54,660
gonna replace just the n3 primer probe

1858
01:26:54,660 --> 01:26:57,030
set but that the other two should be

1859
01:26:57,030 --> 01:26:59,310
good to go a week past the CDC was still

1860
01:26:59,310 --> 01:27:02,160
working on it were they going to change

1861
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:04,170
the sequence no one knew what the

1862
01:27:04,170 --> 01:27:06,150
problem was however in situations like

1863
01:27:06,150 --> 01:27:09,300
this laboratories cannot just adjust a

1864
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:13,890
protocol we are required by CLIA FDA and

1865
01:27:13,890 --> 01:27:16,350
every other alphabet-soup agency to do

1866
01:27:16,350 --> 01:27:19,200
two testing exactly as it is written he

1867
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:21,870
can't homebrew this right a second week

1868
01:27:21,870 --> 01:27:24,090
passed and in a very surprising turn of

1869
01:27:24,090 --> 01:27:26,280
events the associate of public health

1870
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:28,650
laboratories who work very closely with

1871
01:27:28,650 --> 01:27:30,750
the CDC getting a myriad of assays and

1872
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:33,210
programs up and running wrote a harsh

1873
01:27:33,210 --> 01:27:35,160
letter to the FDA asking them to loosen

1874
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:37,350
requirements for emergency authorized

1875
01:27:37,350 --> 01:27:40,980
testing days afterwards the CDC said you

1876
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:43,620
only had to use the first 2n primer

1877
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:47,400
process probe sets they remanufactured

1878
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:49,800
and sent new lots out to all the labs in

1879
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:52,140
about a week and basically we never

1880
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:55,830
speak of the n3 primer probe again she

1881
01:27:55,830 --> 01:27:58,220
gives a link to this for information

1882
01:27:58,220 --> 01:28:01,070
testing requires both a doctor and an

1883
01:28:01,070 --> 01:28:03,570
epidemiologist in testing like this

1884
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:05,550
there has to be an epidemiologist

1885
01:28:05,550 --> 01:28:08,610
sign-off a doctor cannot just order the

1886
01:28:08,610 --> 01:28:11,280
test even with the loosening of the

1887
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:13,230
rules there is paperwork that an

1888
01:28:13,230 --> 01:28:15,330
epidemiologist is required to fill out

1889
01:28:15,330 --> 01:28:17,550
and approve before we can initiate

1890
01:28:17,550 --> 01:28:18,990
testing

1891
01:28:18,990 --> 01:28:21,600
a doctor has a great deal of sway which

1892
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,280
reminds me of a story

1893
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:26,190
about a year ago there was a small merge

1894
01:28:26,190 --> 01:28:28,110
Co V outbreak in the Middle East as

1895
01:28:28,110 --> 01:28:31,170
there is now it was still flu season I

1896
01:28:31,170 --> 01:28:33,420
was working for the laboratory response

1897
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:37,890
network in Texas at the time the this

1898
01:28:37,890 --> 01:28:41,370
network the lrn is the lab that hospital

1899
01:28:41,370 --> 01:28:43,680
labs go to when they can't rule out a

1900
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:47,520
bio threat agent so I get a call after

1901
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:50,460
work does our lab do MERS Co V testing

1902
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:54,390
no we didn't who did the neatest the

1903
01:28:54,390 --> 01:28:57,390
nearest big city or state capital lab

1904
01:28:57,390 --> 01:28:58,410
okay

1905
01:28:58,410 --> 01:29:00,930
well they're going to send over a sample

1906
01:29:00,930 --> 01:29:03,840
that is suspected of MERS Co v4 flu

1907
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:06,480
testing and we need to be ready to

1908
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:09,090
handle it our hospital level is very

1909
01:29:09,090 --> 01:29:11,640
concerned about taking a potential merge

1910
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:14,010
Co V sample and running it over there

1911
01:29:14,010 --> 01:29:17,880
nice new flu PCR machine understandable

1912
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:21,420
but after several meetings we go through

1913
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:23,700
various safety options and decon methods

1914
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:25,880
and they're ready we run the sample and

1915
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:30,570
it's flu A+ I grabbed an aliquot of the

1916
01:29:30,570 --> 01:29:32,310
sample and take it back to our lab to do

1917
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:36,300
the CDC flu panel which generates a type

1918
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:41,870
a type and subtype I run the PCR a h3 I

1919
01:29:41,870 --> 01:29:45,150
so same thing it's flu I later ask the

1920
01:29:45,150 --> 01:29:46,890
original referring hospital for more

1921
01:29:46,890 --> 01:29:48,960
patient information turns out that this

1922
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:51,930
patient also had a rapid antigen flu a

1923
01:29:51,930 --> 01:29:55,650
positive result about 12 hours before we

1924
01:29:55,650 --> 01:29:58,200
got anything while all this was going on

1925
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:00,420
they shipped a sample to the Austin lab

1926
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:03,330
to get tested but even with it being

1927
01:30:03,330 --> 01:30:05,190
cold outside they didn't pack enough

1928
01:30:05,190 --> 01:30:07,560
cold packs so the sample arrived melted

1929
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:09,420
and was considered unsuitable for

1930
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:11,940
testing so they got a new sample packed

1931
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:14,160
it in dry ice and fluid by helicopter to

1932
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:16,190
Austin to get it tested tested all

1933
01:30:16,190 --> 01:30:20,280
because the doctor said the patient was

1934
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:25,260
quote too sick for just the flu so after

1935
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:27,390
quite a bit of extra effort the samples

1936
01:30:27,390 --> 01:30:30,510
was finally tested for MERS Co V it was

1937
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:32,880
found to be negative my advice

1938
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:35,159
all physicians if a patient is flute

1939
01:30:35,159 --> 01:30:41,870
positive they have the flu as a sidenote

1940
01:30:41,870 --> 01:30:44,280
and you don't have to read this as I'm

1941
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:46,260
not interested in fear-mongering

1942
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:48,870
I didn't do my PhD on coronaviruses

1943
01:30:48,870 --> 01:30:50,030
coronaviruses

1944
01:30:50,030 --> 01:30:54,110
are much like polio in the Perez and the

1945
01:30:54,110 --> 01:30:57,270
presence and use of quasi species to

1946
01:30:57,270 --> 01:30:59,580
determine pathogenesis there are reports

1947
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:01,170
or quasi species playing a role in

1948
01:31:01,170 --> 01:31:03,300
pathogenesis there are neurotropic

1949
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:05,610
corona viruses there a mouse in origin

1950
01:31:05,610 --> 01:31:07,620
but they were selected from a strain

1951
01:31:07,620 --> 01:31:09,360
that infects the lungs when cultured

1952
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:12,480
properly so it's quite possible that the

1953
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:14,790
quasi species diversity of the infecting

1954
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:17,040
virus and the diversity generated

1955
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:18,600
throughout infection can impact

1956
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:21,330
intestinal infection as well as

1957
01:31:21,330 --> 01:31:23,670
neurotrophins gives a couple of links to

1958
01:31:23,670 --> 01:31:25,830
that concept thanks for the great

1959
01:31:25,830 --> 01:31:29,760
podcast and if you hear Oh pick me I

1960
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:32,010
know it's probably me yelling at the

1961
01:31:32,010 --> 01:31:37,080
podcast his name is not horshack right

1962
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:39,840
nice now that's Brenna yeah there are

1963
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:42,690
some nootropic Coronas but not these are

1964
01:31:42,690 --> 01:31:45,659
not known to be neurotropic Brenna thank

1965
01:31:45,659 --> 01:31:49,350
you very much for the insight on the CDC

1966
01:31:49,350 --> 01:31:52,080
test and what went on with that because

1967
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:55,980
that was that was as been lightening

1968
01:31:55,980 --> 01:31:58,860
happen thank you very much I would I

1969
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:03,600
would I would like to I don't want to do

1970
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:04,320
it myself

1971
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:07,679
but I would like to go through and shake

1972
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:13,860
down the CDC you know yeah i think i

1973
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:17,370
think they well i got i got people to

1974
01:32:17,370 --> 01:32:19,800
work there it's a great organization we

1975
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:22,350
really need it they do great work but i

1976
01:32:22,350 --> 01:32:24,420
think they need some i think they need

1977
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:27,389
some help and some i don't i will really

1978
01:32:27,389 --> 01:32:29,760
point out without getting political that

1979
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:32,460
they they did recently have a management

1980
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:37,050
change at the top yeah mmm-hmm and i'm

1981
01:32:37,050 --> 01:32:39,120
just gonna set that out there and people

1982
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:41,520
can look into whatever they want to look

1983
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:44,429
into and figure out the the director was

1984
01:32:44,429 --> 01:32:46,539
asked today who's

1985
01:32:46,539 --> 01:32:50,169
directing the diagnostic covetous issue

1986
01:32:50,169 --> 01:32:52,299
and he didn't know and so now they've

1987
01:32:52,299 --> 01:32:55,689
just appointed someone to do that and I

1988
01:32:55,689 --> 01:32:58,299
find it very interesting and I'm

1989
01:32:58,299 --> 01:33:01,329
thankful for it that the really the

1990
01:33:01,329 --> 01:33:06,780
public face of this is Tony foul Qi yes

1991
01:33:06,780 --> 01:33:11,469
it should be at least equally the CDC

1992
01:33:11,469 --> 01:33:14,109
director but it's Tony foul Qi and

1993
01:33:14,109 --> 01:33:15,849
that's appropriate that's good yes you

1994
01:33:15,849 --> 01:33:18,039
know under the circumstances and he's a

1995
01:33:18,039 --> 01:33:20,339
great person to have in that pencil

1996
01:33:20,339 --> 01:33:23,019
absolutely all right he's afraid to be

1997
01:33:23,019 --> 01:33:25,089
critical yes

1998
01:33:25,089 --> 01:33:27,069
all right been rights height Swift team

1999
01:33:27,069 --> 01:33:28,749
on your brief discussion on airplane air

2000
01:33:28,749 --> 01:33:30,369
recirculation I thought it would bump in

2001
01:33:30,369 --> 01:33:31,899
and say that while the air is brought in

2002
01:33:31,899 --> 01:33:33,429
from outside not enough air is brought

2003
01:33:33,429 --> 01:33:36,369
in it is expensive to bring in -60 sea

2004
01:33:36,369 --> 01:33:38,439
air heat at the cabin temp so airlines

2005
01:33:38,439 --> 01:33:40,539
try to keep it to a minimum in terms of

2006
01:33:40,539 --> 01:33:42,789
percent oxygen percent carbon dioxide

2007
01:33:42,789 --> 01:33:45,129
airplane air is now less fresh than when

2008
01:33:45,129 --> 01:33:46,780
it was when people could smoke on plane

2009
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:48,999
because they brought in much more air to

2010
01:33:48,999 --> 01:33:50,849
get rid of visible pollution

2011
01:33:50,849 --> 01:33:53,169
well the cabin air was obviously more

2012
01:33:53,169 --> 01:33:55,209
carcinogenic than I would think less air

2013
01:33:55,209 --> 01:33:56,799
from outside higher co2 could mean

2014
01:33:56,799 --> 01:33:58,719
greater transmission potential thanks

2015
01:33:58,719 --> 01:34:00,069
for all your fantastic worker really

2016
01:34:00,069 --> 01:34:01,629
providing the public with level-headed

2017
01:34:01,629 --> 01:34:03,609
information at a time of mania regards

2018
01:34:03,609 --> 01:34:08,559
from a toilet paper deficiency it's a

2019
01:34:08,559 --> 01:34:12,069
global problem well ice as ralph said

2020
01:34:12,069 --> 01:34:14,229
the transmission seems to be really in

2021
01:34:14,229 --> 01:34:16,119
airplanes really close around to the

2022
01:34:16,119 --> 01:34:18,249
people seething around you but so it's

2023
01:34:18,249 --> 01:34:20,019
still not a good idea to fly because you

2024
01:34:20,019 --> 01:34:21,429
got all these people sitting there for

2025
01:34:21,429 --> 01:34:23,530
what could be hours right yes you're the

2026
01:34:23,530 --> 01:34:24,729
only played person in the plane and

2027
01:34:24,729 --> 01:34:26,079
you're flying it yes

2028
01:34:26,079 --> 01:34:29,229
like do the people in the cockpit get

2029
01:34:29,229 --> 01:34:32,349
the same air as the passengers yes well

2030
01:34:32,349 --> 01:34:33,789
then you should start doing Studies on

2031
01:34:33,789 --> 01:34:35,829
pilots because they're an older bunch of

2032
01:34:35,829 --> 01:34:38,379
people to begin with that's well there

2033
01:34:38,379 --> 01:34:41,079
they are a stringently health screened

2034
01:34:41,079 --> 01:34:47,199
bunch of people that's true so they are

2035
01:34:47,199 --> 01:34:49,269
at risk but to get a class a medical and

2036
01:34:49,269 --> 01:34:51,399
fly for the airlines you you do have to

2037
01:34:51,399 --> 01:34:54,699
pass a I'm not suggesting that they're

2038
01:34:54,699 --> 01:34:56,469
immunocompromised or anything I'm just

2039
01:34:56,469 --> 01:34:57,729
saying that they're an older group of

2040
01:34:57,729 --> 01:35:00,179
people okay

2041
01:35:00,580 --> 01:35:02,290
certainly there they could catch the

2042
01:35:02,290 --> 01:35:05,680
virus and transmit it right there are a

2043
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:07,960
good test for this sort of aerosol

2044
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:10,050
airborne thing because they're locking

2045
01:35:10,050 --> 01:35:12,550
and getting air

2046
01:35:12,550 --> 01:35:14,800
that's - no that's good point that's

2047
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,600
what you take the next one

2048
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:19,570
sure no name rights that's probably not

2049
01:35:19,570 --> 01:35:23,740
their real matter but anyway a high no

2050
01:35:23,740 --> 01:35:26,470
good to meet you hey hey guys not really

2051
01:35:26,470 --> 01:35:28,360
a question more of a comment there were

2052
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:29,980
a lot of questions about masks and their

2053
01:35:29,980 --> 01:35:31,930
utility on episode 590 while I

2054
01:35:31,930 --> 01:35:33,400
understand people wanting answers to

2055
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:34,930
these questions at this point is largely

2056
01:35:34,930 --> 01:35:36,940
academic as they are just not available

2057
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:39,460
anywhere also as rich pointed out a lot

2058
01:35:39,460 --> 01:35:40,750
of people are probably not going to use

2059
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:42,070
them correctly like the woman he was

2060
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:44,260
sitting next to on his recent flight to

2061
01:35:44,260 --> 01:35:45,460
make matters worse this lack of

2062
01:35:45,460 --> 01:35:47,050
availability is probably going to have

2063
01:35:47,050 --> 01:35:48,490
an impact on health care workers and

2064
01:35:48,490 --> 01:35:50,080
first responders which for obvious

2065
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:52,210
reasons is not good something to think

2066
01:35:52,210 --> 01:35:54,190
about at least from my point of view you

2067
01:35:54,190 --> 01:35:55,690
know this would probably be a good time

2068
01:35:55,690 --> 01:35:58,300
to discuss masks right yeah it's a good

2069
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:00,790
time I think those are the reasons why

2070
01:36:00,790 --> 01:36:04,270
they're not recommended by CDC you eat

2071
01:36:04,270 --> 01:36:05,560
them for health care workers and they're

2072
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:07,540
not enough right yeah I think that's

2073
01:36:07,540 --> 01:36:08,860
probably true

2074
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:10,630
I'd also kind of think about the fact

2075
01:36:10,630 --> 01:36:12,040
that I have a hard enough time not

2076
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:14,860
touching my face and I'm sure that if I

2077
01:36:14,860 --> 01:36:17,200
had something on my face annoying me I'd

2078
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:19,960
be touching it even more often I think

2079
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:21,730
that's the other issue is that people

2080
01:36:21,730 --> 01:36:24,850
are not wearing them correctly which I'd

2081
01:36:24,850 --> 01:36:25,720
like to point out

2082
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:29,260
Daniel Griffin's group put out a video

2083
01:36:29,260 --> 01:36:31,390
this weekend for health care workers but

2084
01:36:31,390 --> 01:36:33,490
it's good for everyone on how to Don and

2085
01:36:33,490 --> 01:36:37,630
doff personal protective wear and we'll

2086
01:36:37,630 --> 01:36:38,620
put a link to that in the show notes

2087
01:36:38,620 --> 01:36:39,790
it's really very good

2088
01:36:39,790 --> 01:36:45,040
does he have the Glock 22 in it no no

2089
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:46,600
that is not a health care worker thing

2090
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:51,640
that's and there we've actually been

2091
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:54,520
discussing among the 12 group on slack

2092
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:57,430
in the past week a couple of papers you

2093
01:36:57,430 --> 01:36:58,870
can you can kind of pick your data

2094
01:36:58,870 --> 01:37:00,430
depending on what you want to argue but

2095
01:37:00,430 --> 01:37:03,310
a couple of papers from 2004 including

2096
01:37:03,310 --> 01:37:05,080
one in the CDC Journal emerging

2097
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:10,330
infectious diseases one argues that you

2098
01:37:10,330 --> 01:37:11,530
know presents some data from the

2099
01:37:11,530 --> 01:37:14,530
original SARS epidemic in

2100
01:37:14,530 --> 01:37:18,039
Beijing in 2003 and shows that people

2101
01:37:18,039 --> 01:37:20,710
who did wear a mask had a had a lower

2102
01:37:20,710 --> 01:37:24,670
risk of contracting SARS

2103
01:37:24,670 --> 01:37:26,650
they also found other things that

2104
01:37:26,650 --> 01:37:29,469
correlated with that which included like

2105
01:37:29,469 --> 01:37:30,969
people washing their hands when they

2106
01:37:30,969 --> 01:37:34,030
first came home owning a pet visiting a

2107
01:37:34,030 --> 01:37:35,889
farmers market these were all protective

2108
01:37:35,889 --> 01:37:38,320
so I think there's a lot going on there

2109
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:42,219
besides masks that probably has to do

2110
01:37:42,219 --> 01:37:45,249
with people's personal habits and who

2111
01:37:45,249 --> 01:37:47,289
was more conscientious about social

2112
01:37:47,289 --> 01:37:49,300
distancing and that kind of thing and

2113
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:51,610
then there's a another paper that I

2114
01:37:51,610 --> 01:37:53,920
think Kathy provided in the discussion

2115
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,570
that's also from emerging infectious

2116
01:37:55,570 --> 01:37:59,289
diseases also from 2004 and this was a

2117
01:37:59,289 --> 01:38:03,340
study on nurses in Toronto that found

2118
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:06,789
there was a I'm always a little annoyed

2119
01:38:06,789 --> 01:38:08,619
by this phrase that the risk was reduced

2120
01:38:08,619 --> 01:38:10,690
by consistent use of a surgical mask but

2121
01:38:10,690 --> 01:38:14,769
not significantly statistics note if

2122
01:38:14,769 --> 01:38:15,999
something was not reduced significantly

2123
01:38:15,999 --> 01:38:21,999
it was not reduced so anyway we also had

2124
01:38:21,999 --> 01:38:24,599
some recent conversations about masks

2125
01:38:24,599 --> 01:38:27,309
here because we've realized that there

2126
01:38:27,309 --> 01:38:28,780
are so many different cultural beliefs

2127
01:38:28,780 --> 01:38:32,349
about masks and some people seem to get

2128
01:38:32,349 --> 01:38:35,670
a lot of security out of them and so

2129
01:38:35,670 --> 01:38:38,499
whether or not you choose to wear a mask

2130
01:38:38,499 --> 01:38:41,229
sort of shouldn't involve how you feel

2131
01:38:41,229 --> 01:38:42,909
about others who have decided to wear

2132
01:38:42,909 --> 01:38:45,070
them unless they've decided to wear a

2133
01:38:45,070 --> 01:38:49,119
hockey mask in public trail control some

2134
01:38:49,119 --> 01:38:50,800
conclusions about that I think that

2135
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:54,010
that's true I agree there today is

2136
01:38:54,010 --> 01:38:57,099
Friday 13th by the way it is Friday the

2137
01:38:57,099 --> 01:38:57,789
13th

2138
01:38:57,789 --> 01:39:01,440
breanne can you take the next one sure

greetings twit High Council first of all

2141
01:39:07,179 --> 01:39:09,340
a brief but tremendous thank you for

2142
01:39:09,340 --> 01:39:11,079
your reading and responding to my email

2143
01:39:11,079 --> 01:39:13,449
a few weeks back I can't begin to

2144
01:39:13,449 --> 01:39:15,880
express the heart bursting joy I felt at

2145
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:17,550
hearing your thoughtful advice and

2146
01:39:17,550 --> 01:39:20,110
consideration on how to tackle getting

2147
01:39:20,110 --> 01:39:23,679
started on my ID career midlife I now

2148
01:39:23,679 --> 01:39:26,289
have a juicy list of Doc's in Seattle to

2149
01:39:26,289 --> 01:39:28,360
target and will be doing so this

2150
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:30,580
and feel genuinely bolstered by your

2151
01:39:30,580 --> 01:39:33,490
encouragement I would also like to give

2152
01:39:33,490 --> 01:39:35,110
a shout out to Matt Doherty of the

2153
01:39:35,110 --> 01:39:37,870
Doherty lab at UCSD who sat in my

2154
01:39:37,870 --> 01:39:39,280
backyard five and a half years ago

2155
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:41,530
telling me about chikungunya over beers

2156
01:39:41,530 --> 01:39:43,930
when he saw the light in my eyes and the

2157
01:39:43,930 --> 01:39:45,850
froth billed at my mouth to know more he

2158
01:39:45,850 --> 01:39:47,860
said you know there's a podcast you

2159
01:39:47,860 --> 01:39:53,590
might have a rabies exposure maybe here

2160
01:39:53,590 --> 01:39:56,920
we are today as a virology enthusiast

2161
01:39:56,920 --> 01:39:59,380
this is an exciting time all of a sudden

2162
01:39:59,380 --> 01:40:01,510
everyone wants to talk about viruses

2163
01:40:01,510 --> 01:40:04,120
where I usually am Alec we allocated

2164
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:05,560
only a few minutes of each conversation

2165
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:07,690
with friends and husband to bore them

2166
01:40:07,690 --> 01:40:09,730
with my giddy ramblings about what I

2167
01:40:09,730 --> 01:40:11,770
recently learned on Twix or read about

2168
01:40:11,770 --> 01:40:13,930
whichever history of disease books I

2169
01:40:13,930 --> 01:40:16,900
happen to currently be devouring the

2170
01:40:16,900 --> 01:40:18,310
exception is my seven-year-old daughter

2171
01:40:18,310 --> 01:40:20,440
who regularly asks that we stop reading

2172
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:22,390
15 minutes early each night so that we

2173
01:40:22,390 --> 01:40:26,500
can talk about viruses I have some more

2174
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:29,820
reading to do I like her daughter yes a

2175
01:40:29,820 --> 01:40:32,080
professional podcaster friend actually

2176
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:33,820
asked me to meet up this weekend so I

2177
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:35,710
could help her prepare for a coronavirus

2178
01:40:35,710 --> 01:40:37,330
focused episode she was recording the

2179
01:40:37,330 --> 01:40:39,940
next day with her co-hosts in Italy we

2180
01:40:39,940 --> 01:40:42,430
spent almost four hours talking viruses

2181
01:40:42,430 --> 01:40:44,620
in general and Tsarskoe b2 in particular

2182
01:40:44,620 --> 01:40:47,170
and I shared scores of articles papers

2183
01:40:47,170 --> 01:40:49,330
reports harvested from your episode

2184
01:40:49,330 --> 01:40:51,630
links over the last month it was a hoot

2185
01:40:51,630 --> 01:40:54,280
she had just gotten off a plane and kept

2186
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:56,440
coughing and sneezing her husband and I

2187
01:40:56,440 --> 01:40:58,450
did our best to maintain a metres

2188
01:40:58,450 --> 01:41:00,610
distance from her though our beers were

2189
01:41:00,610 --> 01:41:03,400
collecting respiratory droplets we

2190
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:04,840
debated whether she should wash her

2191
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:07,120
hands before or after using the ketchup

2192
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:10,810
both and we all tapped feet in elbows

2193
01:41:10,810 --> 01:41:12,580
lovingly when we said goodbye at the end

2194
01:41:12,580 --> 01:41:16,030
of the night as you scientists like to

2195
01:41:16,030 --> 01:41:17,560
say so

2196
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:20,650
so as the outbreak situation in Seattle

2197
01:41:20,650 --> 01:41:22,870
is rapidly evolving and my friends

2198
01:41:22,870 --> 01:41:25,420
family spouse are all coming to me not a

2199
01:41:25,420 --> 01:41:27,640
virologist or epidemiologist or public

2200
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:29,110
health professional of any kind and

2201
01:41:29,110 --> 01:41:31,810
asking what should we do I thought I

2202
01:41:31,810 --> 01:41:33,250
would write to you with some updates

2203
01:41:33,250 --> 01:41:35,950
about what is happening here and as what

2204
01:41:35,950 --> 01:41:39,220
should we do since learning that experts

2205
01:41:39,220 --> 01:41:40,840
believe that the virus has likely been

2206
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:42,170
circulating undetected

2207
01:41:42,170 --> 01:41:43,820
here in Washington State for over a

2208
01:41:43,820 --> 01:41:46,340
month people have gone into action

2209
01:41:46,340 --> 01:41:48,170
currently there is a bit of an

2210
01:41:48,170 --> 01:41:50,120
apocalypse come festival atmosphere in

2211
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:52,610
this city for the last 4 days or so

2212
01:41:52,610 --> 01:41:54,380
people have been packing Costco and

2213
01:41:54,380 --> 01:41:55,850
local grocery stores like it's the day

2214
01:41:55,850 --> 01:41:57,590
before Thanksgiving or the Superbowl and

2215
01:41:57,590 --> 01:42:00,320
by 3 p.m. the shelves are cleared of

2216
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:07,400
canned food and toilet paper local

2217
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:09,800
Trader Joe's supported record sales this

2218
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:11,810
past weekend and every drugstore in my

2219
01:42:11,810 --> 01:42:13,429
neighborhood has signs taped in the

2220
01:42:13,429 --> 01:42:15,590
window saying we are sold out of face

2221
01:42:15,590 --> 01:42:18,380
masks and hand sanitizer everyone is

2222
01:42:18,380 --> 01:42:20,060
very concerned and prepping like crazy

2223
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:22,660
but laughing and joking at the same time

2224
01:42:22,660 --> 01:42:24,830
yesterday I had so many light-hearted

2225
01:42:24,830 --> 01:42:26,510
conversations with chipper strangers

2226
01:42:26,510 --> 01:42:28,370
about how many boxes of mac and cheese

2227
01:42:28,370 --> 01:42:30,770
would last 30 days which wine might go

2228
01:42:30,770 --> 01:42:34,610
fast easy I would like to know the

2229
01:42:34,610 --> 01:42:37,310
answer to that question yes people are

2230
01:42:37,310 --> 01:42:39,590
actively preparing but decidedly not

2231
01:42:39,590 --> 01:42:41,949
panicking good good

2232
01:42:41,949 --> 01:42:44,270
that said our governor and County

2233
01:42:44,270 --> 01:42:45,980
Executive have both declared states of

2234
01:42:45,980 --> 01:42:48,650
emergency large companies like f5 and

2235
01:42:48,650 --> 01:42:51,440
REI have closed campuses temporarily and

2236
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:53,330
Facebook and t-mobile have taken

2237
01:42:53,330 --> 01:42:54,739
measures to limit who is coming through

2238
01:42:54,739 --> 01:42:56,810
their doors a number of schools have

2239
01:42:56,810 --> 01:42:59,300
closed King County is in the process of

2240
01:42:59,300 --> 01:43:01,370
buying a motel to house patients who

2241
01:43:01,370 --> 01:43:03,410
need to be isolated and the city is

2242
01:43:03,410 --> 01:43:05,360
setting up modular units to treat and

2243
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:06,980
house the infected among our homeless

2244
01:43:06,980 --> 01:43:09,260
population which is the third largest in

2245
01:43:09,260 --> 01:43:11,270
the US and numbers over five thousand

2246
01:43:11,270 --> 01:43:14,210
people a local immigration office has

2247
01:43:14,210 --> 01:43:16,310
closed for 14 days due to an exposure

2248
01:43:16,310 --> 01:43:18,469
and scores of firefighters are in

2249
01:43:18,469 --> 01:43:20,179
quarantine after being exposed at the

2250
01:43:20,179 --> 01:43:21,830
Kirkland care center that has become the

2251
01:43:21,830 --> 01:43:25,250
epicenter of local outbreak those are

2252
01:43:25,250 --> 01:43:28,610
all really great things to hear I have

2253
01:43:28,610 --> 01:43:30,620
been following all along in real time as

2254
01:43:30,620 --> 01:43:32,239
you have speculated about possible

2255
01:43:32,239 --> 01:43:33,800
outcomes and looked at local and

2256
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:35,239
national containment efforts with a

2257
01:43:35,239 --> 01:43:38,000
critical eye so my big question for you

2258
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,489
is now that it seems clear that there is

2259
01:43:40,489 --> 01:43:42,350
an infectious prodrome and there are

2260
01:43:42,350 --> 01:43:44,510
likely perhaps hundreds of asymptomatic

2261
01:43:44,510 --> 01:43:47,090
people or very minor lis symptomatic

2262
01:43:47,090 --> 01:43:49,640
people who think they have a cold out

2263
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:51,830
shedding virus and coming into contact

2264
01:43:51,830 --> 01:43:54,110
with scores of others every single day

2265
01:43:54,110 --> 01:43:56,120
what should stop should we beat

2266
01:43:56,120 --> 01:43:58,850
to stop this outbreak in its tracks I've

2267
01:43:58,850 --> 01:44:00,350
heard you criticize quarantine and

2268
01:44:00,350 --> 01:44:02,330
travel bans but I've also read the early

2269
01:44:02,330 --> 01:44:04,760
identification quarantine and citizens

2270
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:06,770
changing their daily behavior haven't

2271
01:44:06,770 --> 01:44:08,120
been effective in stopping other

2272
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:10,100
outbreaks our governor in a press

2273
01:44:10,100 --> 01:44:11,660
conference yesterday urged social

2274
01:44:11,660 --> 01:44:13,490
distancing and suggested that working

2275
01:44:13,490 --> 01:44:14,960
from home when sick could be seen as a

2276
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:17,750
patriotic act I like this idea but is

2277
01:44:17,750 --> 01:44:19,580
obviously a luxury of an office worker

2278
01:44:19,580 --> 01:44:21,170
and not something that can be done if

2279
01:44:21,170 --> 01:44:23,150
you're in a service or manufacturing job

2280
01:44:23,150 --> 01:44:25,280
that you will lose if you don't show up

2281
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:27,680
and only working from home while sick

2282
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:29,210
does not solve the problem of the

2283
01:44:29,210 --> 01:44:30,680
asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic

2284
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:32,750
shedder who might be working at a school

2285
01:44:32,750 --> 01:44:34,790
or riding a bus or working out in a gym

2286
01:44:34,790 --> 01:44:39,200
every day I think all of those are very

2287
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:41,920
good points I think that there are that

2288
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:44,660
a lot of what we're doing with social

2289
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:47,210
distancing is great but we do need to

2290
01:44:47,210 --> 01:44:48,740
think about those who are not going to

2291
01:44:48,740 --> 01:44:52,970
be able to do so so if this continues to

2292
01:44:52,970 --> 01:44:54,620
spread should we close schools for a

2293
01:44:54,620 --> 01:44:56,390
month should everyone shelter in place

2294
01:44:56,390 --> 01:44:57,980
for a month which is what the city is

2295
01:44:57,980 --> 01:44:59,540
planning for with their hoarding of

2296
01:44:59,540 --> 01:45:03,890
candies and toilet paper should every

2297
01:45:03,890 --> 01:45:05,300
business that is able ask their

2298
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:07,610
employees to work remotely how does one

2299
01:45:07,610 --> 01:45:09,920
survive like this that is often causing

2300
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:11,600
such mild symptoms from spreading in a

2301
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:13,640
big city well following the advice of

2302
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:15,080
washing our hands and cell phones and

2303
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:17,300
not shaking hands keep us all safe or is

2304
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:18,800
this like Bush's homeland security

2305
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:20,300
telling us that we all need to protect

2306
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:22,070
ourselves in case of a biological or

2307
01:45:22,070 --> 01:45:24,260
chemical terrorist attack was duct tape

2308
01:45:24,260 --> 01:45:28,280
and plastic sheeting hand washing is

2309
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:29,750
more effective than duct tape and

2310
01:45:29,750 --> 01:45:32,330
plastic sheeting hand washing staying

2311
01:45:32,330 --> 01:45:33,980
home all of those things I think are

2312
01:45:33,980 --> 01:45:35,690
going to be important can I just

2313
01:45:35,690 --> 01:45:39,350
interject of course so we were critical

2314
01:45:39,350 --> 01:45:41,780
of quarantine and travel restrictions

2315
01:45:41,780 --> 01:45:45,020
because early on we felt that the

2316
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:47,600
infection should spread and confer hurt

2317
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:51,220
immunity but then we learned of the high

2318
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:53,990
serious complication rate in a certain

2319
01:45:53,990 --> 01:45:56,090
percentage of infections and the

2320
01:45:56,090 --> 01:45:57,530
possibility that that would overwhelm

2321
01:45:57,530 --> 01:45:59,510
the health care system and we saw that

2322
01:45:59,510 --> 01:46:02,480
happen in Wuhan and Italy and for that

2323
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:05,360
reason I think we should reduce the

2324
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:06,699
transmission

2325
01:46:06,699 --> 01:46:08,739
to keep the hospitals able to function

2326
01:46:08,739 --> 01:46:10,750
because they can save people's lives and

2327
01:46:10,750 --> 01:46:12,610
so I think all of these restrictions are

2328
01:46:12,610 --> 01:46:15,190
absolutely good today right now and and

2329
01:46:15,190 --> 01:46:18,010
I would just as somebody who's also been

2330
01:46:18,010 --> 01:46:19,840
particularly critical of quarantine and

2331
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:23,080
travel restrictions in the past I want

2332
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:25,750
to draw a distinction between mandatory

2333
01:46:25,750 --> 01:46:27,910
quarantines and trying to arrest people

2334
01:46:27,910 --> 01:46:31,330
in place and voluntary cancellation of

2335
01:46:31,330 --> 01:46:34,150
events there's a big difference there

2336
01:46:34,150 --> 01:46:37,090
when you when you try to do what China

2337
01:46:37,090 --> 01:46:40,270
did and was uniquely able to do and lock

2338
01:46:40,270 --> 01:46:43,420
down a region the natural human instinct

2339
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:45,010
is to try to try to get the hell out of

2340
01:46:45,010 --> 01:46:47,410
that region and that's gonna make things

2341
01:46:47,410 --> 01:46:52,719
worse by making this more of a voluntary

2342
01:46:52,719 --> 01:46:55,150
thing and telling people look here's

2343
01:46:55,150 --> 01:46:57,940
what the risk is you really ought to

2344
01:46:57,940 --> 01:47:00,280
cancel stuff that doesn't have to be

2345
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:02,140
done that involves interacting with

2346
01:47:02,140 --> 01:47:05,160
other people and I think people are

2347
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:07,660
embracing that certainly from the emails

2348
01:47:07,660 --> 01:47:08,800
I'm now getting from my daughter's

2349
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:12,010
school they're embracing this yeah and

2350
01:47:12,010 --> 01:47:14,050
and that is the kind of approach that

2351
01:47:14,050 --> 01:47:17,500
will work I think because it's it's

2352
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:19,780
motivated from the bottom up rather than

2353
01:47:19,780 --> 01:47:22,600
the top down yeah I agree completely

2354
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:24,400
with everything that you guys are saying

2355
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:27,570
and I also think that I've become more

2356
01:47:27,570 --> 01:47:30,940
Pro sort of social distancing the more I

2357
01:47:30,940 --> 01:47:32,800
have understood about the role of

2358
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:37,660
asymptomatic spread and so we cannot

2359
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:40,630
have just people who are infected stay

2360
01:47:40,630 --> 01:47:42,580
home at this point because we realize

2361
01:47:42,580 --> 01:47:44,590
how important a symptomatic spread is

2362
01:47:44,590 --> 01:47:47,260
and and a lot of the criticism that

2363
01:47:47,260 --> 01:47:48,429
we've leveled against things like

2364
01:47:48,429 --> 01:47:50,110
quarantine travel restrictions was

2365
01:47:50,110 --> 01:47:51,969
during past epidemics of things like

2366
01:47:51,969 --> 01:47:55,510
Ebola virus which is a very very

2367
01:47:55,510 --> 01:47:58,510
different situation yes you're you're

2368
01:47:58,510 --> 01:48:00,340
not gonna have a lot of asymptomatic

2369
01:48:00,340 --> 01:48:02,800
people walking around happy and healthy

2370
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:06,219
and spreading the virus so this is this

2371
01:48:06,219 --> 01:48:08,560
is a very different situation I'd like

2372
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:11,219
to take this opportunity to say that

2373
01:48:11,219 --> 01:48:14,530
this has been on my mind for a little

2374
01:48:14,530 --> 01:48:17,219
while if you go back to the

2375
01:48:17,219 --> 01:48:19,469
our first episodes on this this is now I

2376
01:48:19,469 --> 01:48:22,920
think our seventh podcast on the

2377
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:26,489
coronavirus thing initially as I saw

2378
01:48:26,489 --> 01:48:30,000
this emerging in China I was pretty

2379
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,430
blasé about it and I figured figured it

2380
01:48:32,430 --> 01:48:33,989
would burn out there and I remember in

2381
01:48:33,989 --> 01:48:36,540
particular going through a bunch of my

2382
01:48:36,540 --> 01:48:38,610
own calculations and figuring that it

2383
01:48:38,610 --> 01:48:41,969
wouldn't spread spread much and I was

2384
01:48:41,969 --> 01:48:46,830
dead wrong okay this is proven to be a

2385
01:48:46,830 --> 01:48:49,290
much bigger deal than I ever anticipated

2386
01:48:49,290 --> 01:48:52,469
and I'm going to school on this all

2387
01:48:52,469 --> 01:48:55,290
right what every every day every day as

2388
01:48:55,290 --> 01:48:58,520
a new day as as breanne just said I

2389
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:01,350
really had it drilled into me today for

2390
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:04,350
the first time from Ralph about the

2391
01:49:04,350 --> 01:49:06,480
asymptomatic shedding and that's a big

2392
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:11,430
deal that's a big deal okay so you know

2393
01:49:11,430 --> 01:49:14,250
we can do it we can grow with this

2394
01:49:14,250 --> 01:49:15,469
epidemic

2395
01:49:15,469 --> 01:49:20,699
absolutely so she continues on another

2396
01:49:20,699 --> 01:49:22,199
note I've really enjoyed hearing the

2397
01:49:22,199 --> 01:49:23,610
first-hand accounts from your Chinese

2398
01:49:23,610 --> 01:49:26,310
listeners my husband last night told me

2399
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:27,780
that he had just had a call with his

2400
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:29,940
colleagues in Shanghai and they shared

2401
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:31,140
the measures that they are taking

2402
01:49:31,140 --> 01:49:33,510
currently which include working in

2403
01:49:33,510 --> 01:49:35,400
shifts to limit how many people are in

2404
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:37,650
contact with each other both on transit

2405
01:49:37,650 --> 01:49:39,870
and in the office working from home as

2406
01:49:39,870 --> 01:49:41,969
much as they can calling in to group

2407
01:49:41,969 --> 01:49:43,620
meetings in the office even when they

2408
01:49:43,620 --> 01:49:45,750
are there physically they are no longer

2409
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:47,370
meeting in conference rooms at all and

2410
01:49:47,370 --> 01:49:49,350
doing temperature checks on the way to

2411
01:49:49,350 --> 01:49:52,590
the office each day he told me that one

2412
01:49:52,590 --> 01:49:55,140
of their main trade shows his business

2413
01:49:55,140 --> 01:49:56,270
attends and exhibits at the

2414
01:49:56,270 --> 01:49:58,350
International housewares trade show or

2415
01:49:58,350 --> 01:50:01,590
iha which usually draws about 60,000

2416
01:50:01,590 --> 01:50:03,420
people to Chicago each March from all

2417
01:50:03,420 --> 01:50:06,449
over the world was canceled the long

2418
01:50:06,449 --> 01:50:08,219
ranging effects of this disease on the

2419
01:50:08,219 --> 01:50:10,140
environment and the economy will be

2420
01:50:10,140 --> 01:50:14,640
interesting to watch yeah very true I've

2421
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:16,320
shared a number of articles below

2422
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:18,300
including the potential effects of this

2423
01:50:18,300 --> 01:50:20,280
situation on Chinese pollution levels

2424
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:22,620
how Chinese restaurants in Seattle are

2425
01:50:22,620 --> 01:50:24,360
suffering and an article that explains

2426
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:27,300
that the Seattle flu study a new

2427
01:50:27,300 --> 01:50:28,890
University of Washington group that

2428
01:50:28,890 --> 01:50:30,930
sends swab kits out to the public

2429
01:50:30,930 --> 01:50:32,760
I have three of their boxes sitting next

2430
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:35,160
to my desk in fact and my daughter hates

2431
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:36,930
doing the nose swabs but loves playing

2432
01:50:36,930 --> 01:50:39,270
virologist complete a role in

2433
01:50:39,270 --> 01:50:41,100
identifying the second Washington Kobe

2434
01:50:41,100 --> 01:50:45,540
Cove in nineteen case and lastly there's

2435
01:50:45,540 --> 01:50:47,460
been a lot of talk around here about how

2436
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:49,080
this virus might play out differently in

2437
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:51,030
places like Italy where your job is

2438
01:50:51,030 --> 01:50:52,890
guaranteed even if you stay home sick

2439
01:50:52,890 --> 01:50:55,230
and healthcare is socialized versus the

2440
01:50:55,230 --> 01:50:57,210
US where you can lose your job if you

2441
01:50:57,210 --> 01:50:59,100
don't show up and where many people do

2442
01:50:59,100 --> 01:51:00,660
not have access to health care or the

2443
01:51:00,660 --> 01:51:03,330
means to pay for it yes I think that

2444
01:51:03,330 --> 01:51:04,890
those are also important points to be

2445
01:51:04,890 --> 01:51:06,930
thinking about however it didn't stop

2446
01:51:06,930 --> 01:51:09,720
the outbreak in Italy it certainly did

2447
01:51:09,720 --> 01:51:13,500
not thanks as always for your commitment

2448
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:15,600
to truth seeking and truth sharing and

2449
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:17,310
for always being pedantic and

2450
01:51:17,310 --> 01:51:19,710
entertaining I'm glad somebody likes

2451
01:51:19,710 --> 01:51:23,700
being pedantic it's 52 degrees and

2452
01:51:23,700 --> 01:51:25,530
cloudy here in Seattle with a Chance of

2453
01:51:25,530 --> 01:51:28,410
coronavirus be nice to Dixon and that's

2454
01:51:28,410 --> 01:51:30,810
from Jody what a wonderful letter very

2455
01:51:30,810 --> 01:51:34,460
nice Oh Jody very nice Thank You Jody

2456
01:51:34,460 --> 01:51:37,200
all right there's a bunch of links here

2457
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:38,730
yeah a lot of links thank you so much

2458
01:51:38,730 --> 01:51:41,400
for flat stuff these will be all at this

2459
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:43,380
shownotes microbe dot TV slash twit

2460
01:51:43,380 --> 01:51:45,510
let's do two more Dixon can you take the

2461
01:51:45,510 --> 01:51:46,170
next one

2462
01:51:46,170 --> 01:51:50,400
Kevin writes hi Vincent and Friends

2463
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:52,650
personal protective equipment has been a

2464
01:51:52,650 --> 01:51:54,540
recurrent topic on your show recently

2465
01:51:54,540 --> 01:51:57,600
for good reason I was very interested to

2466
01:51:57,600 --> 01:51:59,580
hear of the article you've been citing

2467
01:51:59,580 --> 01:52:02,340
my radinovich at all that showed little

2468
01:52:02,340 --> 01:52:04,740
difference in effectiveness between n95

2469
01:52:04,740 --> 01:52:07,080
s and the surgical masks in preventing

2470
01:52:07,080 --> 01:52:09,000
occupational exposure to flu in

2471
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,260
healthcare settings

2472
01:52:10,260 --> 01:52:12,720
I thought the attached article might be

2473
01:52:12,720 --> 01:52:14,030
of some interest to you as well

2474
01:52:14,030 --> 01:52:16,070
considered in the light of the

2475
01:52:16,070 --> 01:52:19,260
radinovich study as it shows how much

2476
01:52:19,260 --> 01:52:21,150
performance can diverged between

2477
01:52:21,150 --> 01:52:23,820
idealized control conditions and the

2478
01:52:23,820 --> 01:52:26,040
real world and as you have been

2479
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:28,740
emphasizing and 95s are designed to

2480
01:52:28,740 --> 01:52:30,930
provide protection from airborne droplet

2481
01:52:30,930 --> 01:52:33,390
nuclear eye wear as surgical masks are

2482
01:52:33,390 --> 01:52:36,360
designed to be fluid barriers only this

2483
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:39,030
study demonstrates the magnitude of the

2484
01:52:39,030 --> 01:52:41,070
difference in protective protection

2485
01:52:41,070 --> 01:52:43,920
factors between the two along with

2486
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:44,670
makeshift

2487
01:52:44,670 --> 01:52:46,620
coverings while showing that surgical

2488
01:52:46,620 --> 01:52:48,570
masks to provide some very limited

2489
01:52:48,570 --> 01:52:51,120
benefit against airborne exposure if

2490
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:53,760
used properly it also explores the

2491
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:56,250
reduction in particulates generated when

2492
01:52:56,250 --> 01:52:58,860
masks of various kinds are worn by a

2493
01:52:58,860 --> 01:53:00,810
6-part at the sick person in this

2494
01:53:00,810 --> 01:53:03,690
experiment on mechanical head which is

2495
01:53:03,690 --> 01:53:05,760
surprisingly low and better than nothing

2496
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:10,739
you miss regards I read more

2497
01:53:10,739 --> 01:53:13,140
Kevin McGee yes the same one from your

2498
01:53:13,140 --> 01:53:15,480
IBC a few years back greetings from

2499
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:17,400
Auckland New Zealand where it is a

2500
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:21,870
cloudy 23 degrees C note the FFP to

2501
01:53:21,870 --> 01:53:24,600
masks tested in the attached study are

2502
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:27,780
the Dutch equivalent of the n95 s in

2503
01:53:27,780 --> 01:53:29,550
case attachment doesn't work

2504
01:53:29,550 --> 01:53:33,540
Vander Satya tan citation sorry that's a

2505
01:53:33,540 --> 01:53:35,070
citation that's right yeah just a

2506
01:53:35,070 --> 01:53:37,350
citation okay it's funny okay Evan was

2507
01:53:37,350 --> 01:53:39,600
on the IBC years ago I'm on the

2508
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:42,750
institutional biosafety committee that's

2509
01:53:42,750 --> 01:53:44,520
great that you're listening Kevin Thanks

2510
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:52,280
yes let's do one more rich ok vyd writes

2511
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:54,239
fascinating report you mentioned that

2512
01:53:54,239 --> 01:53:55,920
many different respiratory illnesses

2513
01:53:55,920 --> 01:54:00,480
have fallen in hong kong into in 2020

2514
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:02,760
compared to 2019 right so that was

2515
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:04,699
referring to the graph we did last time

2516
01:54:04,699 --> 01:54:09,170
that suggests that the general sort of

2517
01:54:09,170 --> 01:54:12,630
health awareness standards have impacted

2518
01:54:12,630 --> 01:54:16,170
other diseases if it has been written up

2519
01:54:16,170 --> 01:54:18,179
anywhere I would be interested in a link

2520
01:54:18,179 --> 01:54:20,310
we never got that did we now we got a

2521
01:54:20,310 --> 01:54:23,760
link to the raw numbers from Hong Kong

2522
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:26,370
so you would have to you know for every

2523
01:54:26,370 --> 01:54:28,440
year previous to this one so you'd have

2524
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:32,600
to regress it right I will note however

2525
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:35,429
it has it may be hard to attribute the

2526
01:54:35,429 --> 01:54:37,699
broad decline in to any specific

2527
01:54:37,699 --> 01:54:39,960
interventions as it turns out I was in

2528
01:54:39,960 --> 01:54:41,880
Hong Kong for the month of February

2529
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:44,580
tourism was already down as a result of

2530
01:54:44,580 --> 01:54:46,469
the political instabilities that have

2531
01:54:46,469 --> 01:54:48,929
been ongoing since last summer and was

2532
01:54:48,929 --> 01:54:52,320
absolutely cratered with reports of the

2533
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:55,530
viral outbreak in Wuhan in January hotel

2534
01:54:55,530 --> 01:54:57,179
occupancy --zz were well below

2535
01:54:57,179 --> 01:55:00,690
50% and all of the US carriers cancelled

2536
01:55:00,690 --> 01:55:02,580
all flights between the u.s. and Hong

2537
01:55:02,580 --> 01:55:04,860
Kong and early February fortunately we

2538
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:08,270
were booked on casaya Cathay Pacific

2539
01:55:08,270 --> 01:55:11,520
memories of stars SARS are still fresh

2540
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:13,739
and Hong Kong reacted early and

2541
01:55:13,739 --> 01:55:16,650
aggressively to the Wuhan outbreak music

2542
01:55:16,650 --> 01:55:18,960
schools cultural centers and many

2543
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:21,630
government officers offices were closed

2544
01:55:21,630 --> 01:55:24,330
although most businesses remain open

2545
01:55:24,330 --> 01:55:26,640
everyone was wearing surgical masks on

2546
01:55:26,640 --> 01:55:28,739
the street hand sanitizer dispensers

2547
01:55:28,739 --> 01:55:31,710
were ubiquitous and workers could be

2548
01:55:31,710 --> 01:55:34,110
seen regularly disinfecting elevator

2549
01:55:34,110 --> 01:55:35,880
buttons drawer fixtures and escalator

2550
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:38,640
handrails hotels and high-rises had

2551
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:40,500
people posted at the entrance and we're

2552
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:42,630
measuring the temperature of everyone

2553
01:55:42,630 --> 01:55:44,969
entering the building and yes everyone

2554
01:55:44,969 --> 01:55:46,980
was washing their hands frequently so

2555
01:55:46,980 --> 01:55:49,469
I'm not surprised that the incidence of

2556
01:55:49,469 --> 01:55:51,840
respiratory viruses has fallen broadly

2557
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:54,090
but it's hard to say which specific

2558
01:55:54,090 --> 01:55:56,429
innovation and intervention did how much

2559
01:55:56,429 --> 01:55:58,620
that's a wonderful perspective that's

2560
01:55:58,620 --> 01:56:02,040
great it's important to emphasize that

2561
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:06,300
the infectivity of a virus r0 is not an

2562
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:08,850
intrinsic feature of the virus but also

2563
01:56:08,850 --> 01:56:11,130
depends on the environment and social

2564
01:56:11,130 --> 01:56:13,440
behaviors I'm going to interject here I

2565
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:18,590
believe that are not r0 is in fact an

2566
01:56:18,590 --> 01:56:21,330
intrinsic feature of the virus we use

2567
01:56:21,330 --> 01:56:24,690
these terms inappropriately but there's

2568
01:56:24,690 --> 01:56:29,360
R or R e which is the effective

2569
01:56:29,360 --> 01:56:34,580
reproduction number is r0 that has

2570
01:56:34,580 --> 01:56:37,560
influenced by various social behaviors

2571
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:42,239
okay any rate r0 he says is a

2572
01:56:42,239 --> 01:56:44,219
statistical measure of how many people

2573
01:56:44,219 --> 01:56:47,010
on average on average a case infects

2574
01:56:47,010 --> 01:56:49,320
true if people practice disciplined

2575
01:56:49,320 --> 01:56:52,409
hygiene and social distancing the number

2576
01:56:52,409 --> 01:56:54,690
of new infections will on average fall

2577
01:56:54,690 --> 01:56:56,190
that gives you the effective

2578
01:56:56,190 --> 01:56:59,070
reproduction rate that call ure yes yeah

2579
01:56:59,070 --> 01:57:01,770
re Hong Kong and Singapore have both

2580
01:57:01,770 --> 01:57:04,620
seen lower rates of growth in covent 19

2581
01:57:04,620 --> 01:57:06,840
cases compared to other countries

2582
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:09,680
outside of mainland China

2583
01:57:09,680 --> 01:57:12,320
non-pharmaceutical interventions NPI can

2584
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:14,660
make a big difference and right now they

2585
01:57:14,660 --> 01:57:16,970
all have thanks David

2586
01:57:16,970 --> 01:57:19,580
yes on a previous show you identified me

2587
01:57:19,580 --> 01:57:21,470
as a professor of human genetics at the

2588
01:57:21,470 --> 01:57:23,120
University of Michigan I was in fact

2589
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:25,370
professor of human genetics but that was

2590
01:57:25,370 --> 01:57:27,320
more than a decade ago and I have since

2591
01:57:27,320 --> 01:57:28,820
left to pursue opportunities in

2592
01:57:28,820 --> 01:57:30,560
biotechnology and drug development

2593
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:32,480
I believe Kathy and I have met in the

2594
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:35,030
context of graduate education committees

2595
01:57:35,030 --> 01:57:38,170
Pibbs small world go blue

2596
01:57:38,170 --> 01:57:42,130
David states who wrote to us last week

2597
01:57:42,130 --> 01:57:45,830
as well yeah I think the reproductive

2598
01:57:45,830 --> 01:57:49,250
number is really important and Ralph I

2599
01:57:49,250 --> 01:57:51,830
thought in his discussions referred to

2600
01:57:51,830 --> 01:57:55,610
it several times in in a really

2601
01:57:55,610 --> 01:57:57,650
illuminating fashion because he talked

2602
01:57:57,650 --> 01:58:02,990
about how our healthcare our practices

2603
01:58:02,990 --> 01:58:06,950
public health practices and etc and herd

2604
01:58:06,950 --> 01:58:11,050
immunity ultimately affect the effective

2605
01:58:11,050 --> 01:58:14,210
reproduction rate and the idea is to do

2606
01:58:14,210 --> 01:58:16,250
whatever you can to get that down to

2607
01:58:16,250 --> 01:58:19,520
less than one right where right where

2608
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:22,460
where the you're not amplifying the

2609
01:58:22,460 --> 01:58:24,640
disease and once you get it down to the

2610
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:27,590
effective reproduction number down to

2611
01:58:27,590 --> 01:58:30,320
less than one even though the are not

2612
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:33,410
may still the intrinsic value may still

2613
01:58:33,410 --> 01:58:35,000
be 2 or whatever if you get the

2614
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,220
effective number down to less than one

2615
01:58:37,220 --> 01:58:39,590
now you're gonna squash the disease

2616
01:58:39,590 --> 01:58:42,830
right that's a really nice explanation

2617
01:58:42,830 --> 01:58:43,970
to yeah

2618
01:58:43,970 --> 01:58:48,050
yes I have to say these are all great

2619
01:58:48,050 --> 01:58:50,780
questions and comments we have gotten

2620
01:58:50,780 --> 01:58:54,830
more twit I'm a LAN at any other time in

2621
01:58:54,830 --> 01:58:56,870
our existence it's great we're on page

2622
01:58:56,870 --> 01:59:02,960
16 out of 46 or page 15 out of 46 pages

2623
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:05,180
of emails or continue come in and I have

2624
01:59:05,180 --> 01:59:06,890
to say don't stop because we will get to

2625
01:59:06,890 --> 01:59:11,000
them eventually yep right so if you want

2626
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,220
to see some of these emails micro TV

2627
01:59:13,220 --> 01:59:15,200
slash twit if you want to send some in

2628
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:18,530
please do twit micro TV someone said

2629
01:59:18,530 --> 01:59:20,830
before oh I didn't know you give out

2630
01:59:20,830 --> 01:59:23,270
last names we generally don't unless

2631
01:59:23,270 --> 01:59:23,659
you're at

2632
01:59:23,659 --> 01:59:26,929
doctor or scientist you know we and we

2633
01:59:26,929 --> 01:59:28,400
give out your last name otherwise for

2634
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:31,130
most people we don't because doctors and

2635
01:59:31,130 --> 01:59:32,689
scientists don't have any privacy of

2636
01:59:32,689 --> 01:59:36,769
course we don't need usually if you're

2637
01:59:36,769 --> 01:59:38,510
right in is you have a preference as to

2638
01:59:38,510 --> 01:59:41,169
whether or not we use your name hate it

2639
01:59:41,169 --> 01:59:43,249
many people want to remain an ominous

2640
01:59:43,249 --> 01:59:45,800
that's fine but send them in we will get

2641
01:59:45,800 --> 01:59:48,050
to you but I want to stop here at two

2642
01:59:48,050 --> 01:59:50,239
hours because you got a lot to listen to

2643
01:59:50,239 --> 01:59:52,459
and I think yep that's about enough for

2644
01:59:52,459 --> 01:59:56,380
you and I can't tax my hosts anymore

2645
01:59:58,269 --> 02:00:01,309
well you know if listeners want more of

2646
02:00:01,309 --> 02:00:03,199
I R ology right now just go back and

2647
02:00:03,199 --> 02:00:04,789
listen to that first hour with Ralph

2648
02:00:04,789 --> 02:00:06,679
because that was yeah there's a lot of

2649
02:00:06,679 --> 02:00:09,199
information yes I would agree if you

2650
02:00:09,199 --> 02:00:10,909
like what we do consider supporting us

2651
02:00:10,909 --> 02:00:12,619
financially many new people have joined

2652
02:00:12,619 --> 02:00:14,090
our to support us we really appreciate

2653
02:00:14,090 --> 02:00:16,969
that you can go to micro TV slash

2654
02:00:16,969 --> 02:00:20,929
contribute and use PayPal or patreon to

2655
02:00:20,929 --> 02:00:22,909
give us as little as a dollar a month or

2656
02:00:22,909 --> 02:00:24,880
chunks of money whatever you prefer

2657
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:28,249
Dixon de palma a is at parasites without

2658
02:00:28,249 --> 02:00:30,469
borders calm and the living river org

2659
02:00:30,469 --> 02:00:31,550
thank you Dixon

2660
02:00:31,550 --> 02:00:33,949
pleasure did you teach your course

2661
02:00:33,949 --> 02:00:38,269
online today I did how'd it go yeah it

2662
02:00:38,269 --> 02:00:42,019
was good there's always this disconnect

2663
02:00:42,019 --> 02:00:43,429
that you get when you're talking into a

2664
02:00:43,429 --> 02:00:46,189
screen that's right I like to see their

2665
02:00:46,189 --> 02:00:47,689
reaction to the things that I'm saying

2666
02:00:47,689 --> 02:00:50,269
and I like to stop sure allow them to

2667
02:00:50,269 --> 02:00:52,519
ask questions and it's very difficult is

2668
02:00:52,519 --> 02:00:54,769
to have an interactive experience long

2669
02:00:54,769 --> 02:00:57,800
distance yeah I taught this week and

2670
02:00:57,800 --> 02:01:01,699
gave an exam this week our world had

2671
02:01:01,699 --> 02:01:03,709
office hours yesterday which was all

2672
02:01:03,709 --> 02:01:07,479
questions about SARS Kofi - nothing

2673
02:01:07,479 --> 02:01:09,909
should I go home for spring break

2674
02:01:09,909 --> 02:01:13,760
yeah that's right off Brianne Barker's

2675
02:01:13,760 --> 02:01:15,800
over at Drew University in New Jersey on

2676
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:18,880
Twitter bio prof Barker thanks Brianne

2677
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:21,309
thanks it was really great to be here

2678
02:01:21,309 --> 02:01:24,019
and I also have been learning how to

2679
02:01:24,019 --> 02:01:27,349
teach online the past few days and I'm

2680
02:01:27,349 --> 02:01:30,979
gonna start teaching with zoom on Monday

2681
02:01:30,979 --> 02:01:34,939
yeah that's what I use and that's it for

2682
02:01:34,939 --> 02:01:36,409
the rest of the semester exams well

2683
02:01:36,409 --> 02:01:37,550
teaching it's all online

2684
02:01:37,550 --> 02:01:40,690
I think that's a good idea easy to use

2685
02:01:40,690 --> 02:01:45,050
sorry Dixon I said zoom is easy to use

2686
02:01:45,050 --> 02:01:47,239
now here twit we use Skype for this

2687
02:01:47,239 --> 02:01:49,190
because I think the it's easier to get

2688
02:01:49,190 --> 02:01:51,020
good sound done that's guy even a

2689
02:01:51,020 --> 02:01:52,520
caveman living in Fort Lee New Jersey

2690
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:56,059
can use it apparently rich Condit is it

Alan dove Thank You Alan thank you it's

2697
02:02:12,739 --> 02:02:14,150
always a pleasure and by the way I've

2698
02:02:14,150 --> 02:02:15,860
been social distancing since before it

2699
02:02:15,860 --> 02:02:17,800
was cool

2700
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:23,119
hey healthy well now we resume our

2701
02:02:23,119 --> 02:02:26,480
normal schedule a I'm not traveling home

2702
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:31,099
time at yeah I'm here so we're gonna be

2703
02:02:31,099 --> 02:02:33,679
recording every Friday and sorry we'll

2704
02:02:33,679 --> 02:02:35,599
be back good to have you because some of

2705
02:02:35,599 --> 02:02:37,550
us I have been traveling a lot the last
