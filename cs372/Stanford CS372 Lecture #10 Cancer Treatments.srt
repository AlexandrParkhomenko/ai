1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,680
good morning welcome back to cs

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,480
372 artificial intelligence for

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,400
disease diagnosis and the information

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,320
recommendations

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,440
and the last time dr melissa ko gave us

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,480
a lecture on

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,080
cancer causes and the diagnosis

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,560
and today we welcome melissa to come

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,600
back to give us

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,640
the second lecture on cancer focusing on

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,439
cancer treatment including radiology

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,199
surgery chemotherapy

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,120
and targeted therapy and immunotherapy

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,399
let's welcome melissa

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,440
awesome welcome back everyone so yeah we

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,040
will be continuing with sort of

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,760
the second half of what we spoke about

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,879
last week

19
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,239
so last week we really thought about

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,360
how is cancer caused how do we diagnose

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:53,680
it

22
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,480
and so really looking at what's going on

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,800
in our cells and in our dna that

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,000
leads to cancer and

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,199
thinking about those different features

26
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,439
of a cancer cell and maybe how that

27
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,320
might

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,000
contribute to what we're looking for in

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,479
cancer like diagnosing it as an earlier

30
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,479
stage versus a later stage as a more

31
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,400
aggressive cancer or a less aggressive

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,360
cancer

33
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,759
and ultimately i think it was clear from

34
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,920
that conversation that our goal when we

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,920
were diagnosing is ultimately that might

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,799
guide

37
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,720
better treatment so we're going to

38
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,520
continue that conversation today

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,520
so what i'm planning on talking about

40
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,560
today is

41
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,159
giving you a sense of a lot of the

42
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,320
existing treatments for cancer

43
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,159
so we have what i guess i'd call

44
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,920
traditional cancer treatments which are

45
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,840
probably the ones you've heard about

46
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,240
or seen in like popular media whenever

47
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,240
cancer comes up whether it be in a tv

48
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,320
show or a book

49
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,920
there's typical types of cancer

50
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,600
treatment that we've been using for many

51
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,880
many years

52
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,520
i'll talk about some more recent cancer

53
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,119
therapies

54
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,200
and then we'll talk a bit about what the

55
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,200
issue is with those therapies so what is

56
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,560
the issue with the therapies that we

57
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,880
usually use to treat cancer

58
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,758
how is it that cancers become resistant

59
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,120
to treatment

60
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,200
and what are some possible workarounds

61
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,040
for that and then i'll again

62
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,599
talk about um machine learning

63
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,080
applications so we'll think about how

64
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,120
could machine learning help with

65
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,360
discovering new drugs or discovering

66
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,040
better drugs or discovering more

67
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,840
effective combinations of drugs

68
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,440
and then i will talk a bit about

69
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,440
immunotherapy i know immunotherapy

70
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,200
is a big area of interest for

71
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,680
for a lot of us um i think compared to a

72
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,160
lot of

73
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,640
recent innovations with uh cancer

74
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,160
treatment and immunotherapy is sort of

75
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,560
just like a different approach

76
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,120
and i think before it was kind of like

77
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,400
you can imagine we drop

78
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,720
we developed drug a and we were kind of

79
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,760
incrementally

80
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,200
improving on drug a or just slightly

81
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,920
um you know pairing drug a with drug b

82
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,319
to slightly improve the efficacy

83
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,000
but immunotherapy is like let's just

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,360
take a new approach

85
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,400
and in some ways that maybe will be more

86
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,000
effective especially for certain

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,959
patients

88
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,400
so i'll talk a bit about immunotherapy

89
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,040
and then i'll just touch on um

90
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,200
areas of work and maybe areas that

91
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,720
connect to careers you might be

92
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,560
interested in and i did

93
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,760
try to consciously leave more time

94
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,760
so i think i have fewer slides and fewer

95
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,040
things to touch on than

96
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,120
last week so hopefully that'll give

97
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,040
space if we want to have a more open

98
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,000
conversation

99
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,280
and you can ask either about research or

100
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,720
about sort of transferable

101
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,040
skills or ideas if you're interested in

102
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,040
like the healthcare context or cancer

103
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,799
biology context

104
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,680
so that's the plan for today um let me

105
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,760
get started first off

106
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,000
before we kind of jump right into

107
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,159
talking about cancer treatments i did

108
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,720
want to talk a little bit about

109
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,560
again i think last time i gave an

110
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,840
example of like different

111
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,439
types of machine learning approaches so

112
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,760
like supervised versus unsupervised

113
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,000
learning how they relate to cancer like

114
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,159
what are the types of problems we think

115
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,760
about in the context of cancer when

116
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,879
we're thinking about

117
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,200
using clustering or using different

118
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,519
types of modeling like classification

119
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,959
regression um so those are kind of like

120
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,960
paradigms for like types of problems

121
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,479
you'd solve and how they relate to

122
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,199
cancer

123
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,960
but i also want to talk a little bit

124
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,360
methodology wise

125
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,759
one thing that comes up a lot in cancer

126
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,560
is this

127
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,040
you know well it comes up in machine

128
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,720
learning is this trade-off between

129
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,440
very complex and accurate models but

130
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,080
they become

131
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,080
models that you can't really scrutinize

132
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,440
like you don't know what's happening

133
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,040
under the hood it's just sort of a black

134
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,840
box

135
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,600
you feed in your inputs and you might

136
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,960
get really accurate

137
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,040
outputs whether that be a regression or

138
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,479
a classification

139
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,080
but you don't know what's happening per

140
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,680
se in the model

141
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,360
and so this actually comes up a lot when

142
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,840
we are working as researchers

143
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,479
in terms of how do we choose which model

144
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,120
to use

145
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,919
and it really kind of where we fall on

146
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,000
the spectrum of preferring accuracy and

147
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
giving up the interpretability versus

148
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,919
preferring interpretability and giving

149
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,120
up accuracy

150
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,600
kind of depends ultimately on our goal

151
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,960
as researchers

152
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,360
so for example as a cancer researcher if

153
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,240
your goal

154
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,520
is really to try to

155
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,720
reveal how cancer works

156
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,039
so this comes up a lot in sort of basic

157
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,639
research thinking about

158
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,000
how how is the cancer functioning does

159
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,600
um does the cancer function

160
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,960
um so in that sense when we're trying to

161
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,160
model a process

162
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,039
we're really interested in what are the

163
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:45,759
important

164
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,560
features what is leading to one outcome

165
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,680
over another

166
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,840
and so it's not just enough if your goal

167
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,440
is to understand the cancer

168
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,000
to say oh yeah you as a patient have the

169
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,919
aggressive cancer and you as a patient

170
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,560
have the less aggressive cancer we want

171
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,400
to know what's leading to that

172
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,680
distinguishing that distinction between

173
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,720
the two

174
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,120
is there a really important feature in

175
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,720
our cells is it a really important

176
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,800
mutation like we want to

177
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,720
be able to pull the model apart and

178
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,639
reveal what that feature

179
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,160
is and so a lot of like how does cancer

180
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,600
work kind of problems we

181
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,639
we tend towards these more simple models

182
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,560
but then of course i think there is the

183
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,039
clinical application which kind of falls

184
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,639
up here

185
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,400
which is where there are definitely

186
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,319
people whose ultimate goal is you know i

187
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:34,720
have

188
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,880
real-life patients humans dealing with

189
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,280
cancer i just want to be able to

190
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,759
have high certainty high accuracy and

191
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,400
telling them

192
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
oh you have this type of cancer this is

193
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,479
the best treatment regimen for you

194
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,199
and so when you're thinking about how to

195
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:49,840
approach

196
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,479
cancer research really knowing is your

197
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,039
goal to

198
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,360
understand cancer better or is your goal

199
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,319
just to

200
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,280
you know optimize something so that you

201
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,240
maximize the good for your patients

202
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,680
and that's something that we struggle

203
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,960
with we know that all like cancer is so

204
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,639
complicated that a lot of the more

205
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,919
simple models

206
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,080
are definitely over simplifications of

207
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,160
how cancer works but ultimately our goal

208
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,680
might be just trying to

209
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,080
pull apart like what are the mutations

210
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,240
that that contribute to cancer

211
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,240
and those kinds of things would be lost

212
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,720
if we used really complicated models

213
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,160
that make it really hard to figure out

214
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,680
what's going on

215
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,919
so this is a trade-off that we struggle

216
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,599
a lot with and it just kind of depends

217
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,840
as a researcher like what are you

218
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,919
ultimately trying to contribute to

219
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,400
by giving doctors the best tool and

220
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,000
giving the best tool for patients

221
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,440
or just like furthering our

222
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,120
understanding of the cancer

223
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,400
all right so let's return to our

224
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,759
case study from last week so you might

225
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,440
remember that last week what we talked

226
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,680
about was our neighbor sasha has been

227
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,120
diagnosed with stage

228
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,319
four pancreatic cancer so

229
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,319
you both know the stage of the cancer

230
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,160
and you also know the type of the cancer

231
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,759
it originated in the pancreas

232
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,800
if you remember last time one thing we

233
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,240
noticed was that

234
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,240
and what contributed to the diagnosis of

235
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,240
stage four was that it was affecting

236
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,800
the kidneys as well so it is a cancer

237
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,280
that has metastasized or it has spread

238
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,759
to another organ and so what i want you

239
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,599
to just spend a quiet moment

240
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,599
reflecting on and you can share your

241
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,319
ideas in the chat is

242
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,240
what treatment options do you know for

243
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,399
cancer and which ones do you think would

244
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,360
work or not work in the scenario so you

245
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,880
can just sort of recall what you've

246
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,880
heard about for cancer

247
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,559
and then think about which ones do you

248
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,880
think would be used here

249
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,519
and and may help versus ones that might

250
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,800
not help

251
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,560
so just take a quiet moment to think

252
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,480
about that and again share your answers

253
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,839
in chat

254
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,680
yeah so i see people mentioning

255
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,959
chemotherapy

256
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,080
and surgery um

257
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,440
so i'm seeing comments about

258
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,760
chemotherapy and how effective

259
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,800
it might be um again there's a lot of

260
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,800
trade-offs or chemotherapy itself

261
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,800
um chemotherapy is a very harsh

262
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,240
treatment which we'll talk about in a

263
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,279
second

264
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,200
um and then surgery think about surgery

265
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,880
um

266
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,160
surgery you would need to know where the

267
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,079
tumor is and you might clearly know

268
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,440
where the tumor is

269
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,200
with regards to the pancreas and maybe

270
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,480
even the kidney

271
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,160
but one thing that's never really clear

272
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,000
with a cancer that is late stage

273
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,920
and that has spread is is it somewhere

274
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,680
else and we just don't know it yet and

275
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,000
so that makes surgery really difficult

276
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,079
um and you can imagine with a very sick

277
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,320
patient you don't want to keep

278
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,360
putting them under the stress of

279
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,600
surgery awesome thank you for your ideas

280
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,240
so yes i think really thinking carefully

281
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,519
about what will work

282
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,519
at this stage in the game knowing that

283
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,600
the patient is probably

284
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,240
sick and will only get sicker knowing

285
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,120
that the cancer

286
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,160
isn't localized it has spread all of

287
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,519
those are kind of

288
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,200
information that will inform our

289
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,680
decision and generally speaking

290
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,000
when you're asking up if well if you're

291
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,160
faced with a patient who has

292
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,079
cancer and you you know the first

293
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,320
question we often ask is staging because

294
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,160
that tells us a little bit about

295
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,120
how bad it is you know how how far along

296
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,680
it is what is what are their chances

297
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,279
but really from the treatment

298
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,519
perspective it really guides what we're

299
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,800
going to do about it

300
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,040
and so this example here i believe this

301
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,640
is taken from

302
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,600
this is taken from colon cancer this

303
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,279
mapping is really showing you like what

304
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,079
would you do

305
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,880
if cancer was early versus what would

306
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,079
you do if cancer

307
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,360
is late stage and so what you can

308
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,920
actually kind of see from here is that

309
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,560
certain things become more of an option

310
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,399
at different stages and versus other

311
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,120
things sort of

312
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,320
fade out and so an example given give

313
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,839
here is that when uh

314
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,760
colon cancer is developing it's just

315
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,839
usually a small growth which we'll call

316
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:50,880
a polyp

317
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,880
and if you find that polyp early you

318
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,240
just cut the polyp out

319
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,320
like usually it's kind of a benign

320
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,600
growth i guess the way you could

321
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,839
visualize it is kind of like

322
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,079
the way you'd picture like a wart on the

323
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,000
surface of your skin just imagine that

324
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,040
on the surface

325
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,279
of the lining of your gut like that's

326
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,440
how we think of a polyp it's like it's a

327
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,000
abnormal growth but maybe it hasn't had

328
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,200
the chance to like really

329
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,959
it be invasive like in its own context

330
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:17,600
or beyond

331
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,920
its own context to other organs and so

332
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,279
you just cut it out

333
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,200
and so that's definitely the main option

334
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,120
that you would pursue early on there's

335
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,720
really no

336
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,320
reason at that point to use chemotherapy

337
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,320
or any of these additional lines of

338
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,040
treatment you

339
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,839
just cut it out versus as what you can

340
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,079
see in this diagram sort of as you go

341
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,480
further along this is the surgery option

342
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,000
you can see it kind of just

343
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,920
fades out here because when you're

344
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,040
dealing with

345
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,079
metastasized cancer again maybe you

346
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,200
could cut out

347
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,639
the main tumor or the tumors that you've

348
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,760
identified

349
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,920
but again it's a trade-off where if the

350
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,680
cancer is metastasized generally

351
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,600
speaking

352
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,760
surgery at that stage is not going to

353
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,880
cure the patient

354
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,600
it's more like is it worth it to maybe

355
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,800
alleviate their

356
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,440
symptoms like to relieve pain so if

357
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,160
there's a

358
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,639
giant tumor and you know that tumor is

359
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,360
metastasized

360
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,040
somewhere else the only reason why you

361
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,800
might consider surgery is if it's sort

362
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,000
of

363
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
you know if that in combination with

364
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,760
other things might

365
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,360
eliminate the entire cancer and

366
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,360
everywhere it's spread or if the patient

367
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,959
is suffering a lot you might consider

368
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,240
cutting out the tumor

369
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,839
just because it that tumor is probably

370
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,680
still a huge burden and leading to lots

371
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,000
of

372
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,480
uh effects on their health but you can

373
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,160
see in terms of really thinking about it

374
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,480
as

375
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,880
curative at that point surgery is no

376
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,040
longer curative so it kind of fades out

377
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,639
as an option

378
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,199
um radiation is similar um we'll talk

379
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,639
about radiation in a second but

380
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,240
radiation generally tends to be

381
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,000
something that kind of like

382
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,839
surgery you kind of want to point to a

383
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,240
specific space and say treat here

384
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,079
and so again radiation you don't want to

385
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,079
radiate the whole body you're trying to

386
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,680
target the radiation and we'll talk

387
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,199
about why we use radiation in a second

388
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,760
and then in terms of options that become

389
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,560
more

390
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,760
relevant as we get into later stages

391
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,279
chemotherapy is one of them so you can

392
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,279
see chemotherapy sort of fades in

393
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,240
as we go further along in staging and

394
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,440
then there are some more

395
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,959
targeted therapies that we use

396
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,480
especially for aggressive

397
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,920
and late stage cancer

398
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,360
and we'll talk about these different

399
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,199
targeted therapies here

400
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,079
compared to the general chemotherapy

401
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,839
which is probably the most common

402
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,839
treatment that you've heard about so

403
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,440
this anti-anagen

404
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,839
sorry anti-angiogenic therapy and this

405
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,440
anti-egfr therapy

406
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,360
those are targeted therapies and those

407
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,720
are ones that

408
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,560
might be used for more more than one

409
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,160
type of cancer but you might not have

410
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,120
heard about it in

411
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,279
any cancer context like these these

412
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,279
specific ones listed here aren't ones

413
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,399
that you see used in

414
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,480
every type of cancer you might have

415
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,560
heard about them in the context of

416
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,760
you know lung cancer or maybe brain

417
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,480
cancer

418
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,079
but you don't hear them with literally

419
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,519
every type of cancer

420
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,720
and that's because there is some

421
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,079
specificity involved

422
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,600
all right so let's talk a little bit

423
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,040
about how these treatments work

424
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,360
so what i can just say is that in

425
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,480
general most

426
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,720
classic cancer treatments the way they

427
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,519
work

428
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,040
this might seem obvious but we're going

429
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,120
to kind of dig into this a little more

430
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,680
is that

431
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,680
they the way they work is they're either

432
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,360
physically removing the tumor in the

433
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,240
tumor cells

434
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,480
which you know is the case for surgery

435
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,079
or they're inducing what we call

436
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,440
cytotoxic effects on the cancer cell

437
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,839
so surgery over here you just cut it out

438
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:38,480
you cut out

439
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,560
the tissue there's definitely a

440
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,680
challenge where you're trying to think

441
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,680
of the margins of like

442
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,279
how big is this tumor how much will this

443
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,199
affect the patient negatively if

444
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,360
i've cut out such a big part of their

445
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,240
body

446
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,720
um and you don't want to like miss some

447
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,320
by accident so that's definitely the

448
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,320
struggle with surgery

449
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,680
versus the cytotoxic effect really is

450
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,519
taking advantage of you know we talked a

451
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,720
bit about

452
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,320
cells and dna and the goal of cytotoxic

453
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,639
effects is that you're killing cancer

454
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,000
cells specifically

455
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,639
and trying not to harm normal healthy

456
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:15,440
cells

457
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,759
which is challenging as we'll talk about

458
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:18,560
in a second

459
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,800
but basically we're either cutting out

460
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,399
and removing the tumor tissue from the

461
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,199
body

462
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,240
or we're trying to induce cell death in

463
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,440
the tumor cells specifically

464
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,480
so how do we induce cell death so

465
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,040
radiation is one way as i said radiation

466
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,639
is something that generally has to be

467
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,639
you want it to be targeted you don't

468
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,920
want to sort of be

469
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,720
introducing radiation to healthy parts

470
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,000
of the body

471
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,480
um radiation has been talked about in

472
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,639
terms of oh we use it for

473
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,040
diagnostics like we take an x-ray and we

474
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,680
might see

475
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,600
something that looks abnormal right so

476
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,759
we both use it on the end of

477
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,360
you know when we first have a patient

478
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,800
coming into the clinic we might use this

479
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,800
to diagnose that there's something wrong

480
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,680
and

481
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,920
lead to the diagnosis of cancer but

482
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,760
we're also using it on the treatment end

483
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,760
where we're taking this radiation and in

484
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,400
really high concentrated strong

485
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,959
doses we aim it at where we think the

486
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,000
tumor is

487
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,280
and when radiation hits the tumor

488
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,319
um it basically is inducing

489
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,959
damage to the dna so i think i showed

490
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,880
last time the example of

491
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,039
um a mutagen like a cancer-causing agent

492
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,360
was radiation so when your skin for

493
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
example is exposed to a lot of

494
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,000
sun it gets a lot of uv radiation and

495
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,880
especially if you

496
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,600
are prone to getting a lot of sunburns

497
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,320
that's sort of

498
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,360
representing that this this your cells

499
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,480
and your skin are getting

500
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,880
a lot of radiation dosages and it's

501
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,160
probably actually hurting

502
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,120
those cells because like basically the

503
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,200
radiation hits your dna and can cause

504
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,360
that dna to mutate

505
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,440
when that happens in our body our cells

506
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,799
will usually

507
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,400
spot that there's something wrong and

508
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,919
try to repair

509
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,559
the damage but if you have an incredibly

510
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,520
high dosage

511
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,080
of radiation all at once generally

512
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,760
speaking there'll be so much damage to

513
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,559
the dna

514
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,240
that it's kind of hard for the cells to

515
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,320
repair and they actually will tend to

516
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,760
make the decision

517
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,440
to basically kill a compromised cell

518
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,960
like if there's a cell that's highly

519
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,520
mutated it is beyond repair

520
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,760
that cell will generally speaking die it

521
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,440
won't be able to recover from that much

522
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,880
damage

523
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,440
so here you can just imagine we're

524
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,919
taking high doses of radiation we aim it

525
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,000
at where we think the tumor is and we

526
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,400
sort of

527
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,039
shoot the radiation there induce mass

528
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,360
amounts of dna damage in those cancer

529
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,880
cells and those cancer cells

530
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,400
generally speaking might not be able to

531
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,080
recover from it

532
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,520
um so of course again that becomes

533
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,039
less of an option if the tumor isn't

534
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,480
localized because we don't want to just

535
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,240
radiate the whole patient right if the

536
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,679
cancer cells have sort of spread

537
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,000
everywhere

538
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,360
and we don't know where we are we don't

539
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,520
want to introduce that radiation

540
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,880
anywhere right because that's going to

541
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,360
be harming and mutating

542
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,160
normal cells too if we don't focus it so

543
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,919
again that becomes less of an option in

544
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,000
late stage

545
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,600
um if there are any questions i have the

546
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,120
chat open but you can also

547
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,960
click the raise hand button and i'm

548
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,039
happy to answer questions as i go you

549
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:17,760
don't have to

550
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,600
just wait to the end i'll keep an eye if

551
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,320
i see any

552
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,480
all right and let's talk about

553
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,480
chemotherapy chemotherapy is actually

554
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,400
pretty similar it's just the delivery

555
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,080
mechanisms very different

556
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,880
um i'll say generally speaking a lot of

557
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,480
chemotherapies actually

558
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,039
mess with our dna mess with dna's

559
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,160
ability to

560
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,400
replicate itself so if a cell is

561
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,440
dividing

562
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,360
it needs to make a second copy of its

563
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,960
dna so that the two

564
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,360
resulting daughter cells both have their

565
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,880
own copy of dna

566
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,960
and so if that process is messed with

567
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,160
then those cells just

568
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,080
don't divide or they divide and they run

569
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,760
into issues and that might either

570
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,679
stall them in the middle of dividing or

571
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,280
they might die because they can't

572
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,799
recover they're kind of like stuck and

573
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,120
they kind of can't fix it so at some

574
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,240
point they will

575
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,840
those cells will just die because they

576
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,320
can't resolve the issue

577
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,840
and then some of these chemotherapies

578
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,520
will mess with cell cycle which again is

579
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,360
that process of cells dividing

580
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,280
so there's a particular drug for example

581
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,440
that messes with the ability

582
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,240
of the cells to sort of partition

583
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,080
themselves like they're trying to move

584
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,919
things around so that they can split

585
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,200
into two cells

586
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,240
and basically the the physical things

587
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,240
that help with the

588
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,760
manipulations and pulling things apart

589
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,280
actually just stops working and so

590
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,480
they're just kind of frozen

591
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,640
in place so there's lots of different

592
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,000
chemotherapies that basically

593
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,840
mess with these processes they mess with

594
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,440
our dna they mess with

595
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,679
making more dna they mess with cells

596
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,280
dividing

597
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,400
and as then as that kind of implies

598
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,039
that's kind of a problem because

599
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,760
healthy cells have dna too healthy cells

600
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,840
replicate themselves too

601
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,679
um and so this really hints at why

602
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,240
chemotherapy has so many side effects

603
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,559
because when you're introducing a drug

604
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,320
and i'm just showing a drug here this

605
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,600
is um cisplatin specifically

606
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,840
it's a very commonly used chemotherapy

607
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,919
it's used with

608
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,559
breast cancer probably also lung cancer

609
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,159
lots of different cancers use cis

610
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,520
platins or or

611
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,919
related drugs like carboplatin which is

612
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,159
just a different chemical formulation

613
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,559
but all of these drugs basically go in

614
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,480
and stick to your dna

615
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,880
and that causes dna damage so you can

616
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,640
see here with this uh little

617
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,960
this little chemical here it's going in

618
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,080
and it's basically

619
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,320
sticking itself physically like it's

620
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,720
chemically reacting with our dna

621
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,000
and this in the mind of the cell is

622
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,200
damage it's basically messing with

623
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,520
your dna structure and so if we were

624
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,400
trying to

625
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,600
read this dna or trying to copy this dna

626
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,840
we would run into issues because the

627
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,760
chemical structure of the dna is

628
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,880
different

629
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,559
um and so this is particularly potent

630
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,880
for cancer cells um cancer cells are

631
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,080
kind of

632
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,720
how do i describe them they're kind of

633
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,120
like

634
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,360
cancer cells may come across as very

635
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,760
powerful in terms of all these

636
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,360
additional abilities and the fact that

637
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,840
they sort of um

638
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,559
conquer the environment they're in like

639
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,520
they basically

640
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,559
can kind of uh you know hijack certain

641
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,200
processes

642
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,640
you know steal blood vessels steal

643
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,480
resources but they kind of also just

644
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,600
like

645
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,320
rule over the normal cells around them

646
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,679
because the normal cells around them

647
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,440
obey all these rules and the cancer

648
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,880
cells obey no rules

649
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,960
so they seem very powerful but cancer

650
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,280
cells also kind of are skirting the line

651
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,559
where they are so

652
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,039
that they themselves are so warped and

653
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,000
mutated

654
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,760
in some ways they actually can be very

655
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,080
fragile and so when you're

656
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,919
giving them dna damage sometimes they're

657
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,760
like yes more mutations like this makes

658
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,440
me more powerful but then too many and

659
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,000
they actually

660
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,559
don't have the normal means of resolving

661
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,120
them

662
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,640
and so they can actually be more

663
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,480
sensitive to things that mess with cell

664
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,159
cycle or mess with their dna

665
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,320
because they just they've lost the means

666
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,240
to repair those so they were kind of

667
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,600
super powerful and then they got too

668
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,280
much of it and then they just sort of

669
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,360
give up eat more easily because they

670
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,960
just can't fix it

671
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,200
um but yeah this is also a problem for

672
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,480
healthy cells too

673
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,799
having this sort of compound go around

674
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:19,840
and bind

675
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,080
to dna and especially mess with dna in

676
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,360
cells that divide

677
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,280
that's what leads to a lot of the side

678
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,320
effects that we see with chemotherapy

679
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,679
when we're thinking about treating

680
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,120
patients with chemotherapy it's

681
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,400
basically

682
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,919
this really careful balance that's

683
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,600
sensitive to the patient

684
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,159
it senses the patient's age and like

685
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,520
coexisting

686
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,840
health conditions like if a patient has

687
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,919
cancer but they also have

688
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,400
um they're also older or maybe they also

689
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,559
have diabetes they have other

690
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,559
conditions um when we're trying to

691
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,320
figure out how much chemotherapy to give

692
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,919
them they're sort of this instinct to

693
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:56,640
give

694
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,320
tons of chemotherapy right like they're

695
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,679
fighting this battle with cancer and

696
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:00,799
we're trying to

697
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,480
kill as much of the cancer cells as

698
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,080
possible but basically

699
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,720
as we ramp up the the dosage of the

700
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,559
chemo we just get more and more

701
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,000
negative side effects and there are some

702
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,640
patients where literally if we just kept

703
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,960
giving them chemo the chemo would end up

704
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,880
killing them because the chemo

705
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,120
does things like it harms the lining of

706
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,440
their gut it harms

707
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,679
their ability to produce blood cells so

708
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,440
they become very anemic

709
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,480
um all of these things are like symptoms

710
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,400
that you may have heard cancer or sorry

711
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,360
cancer patients

712
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,760
experience and that's being caused by

713
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,720
the chemo

714
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,559
like of course the cancer is hurting

715
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,880
them and is causing issues but a lot of

716
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,120
the sort of hair loss

717
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,039
nausea and vomiting anemia

718
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,520
skin issues like a lot of those are

719
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,360
coming from actually the chemo

720
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,880
and so we're trying to give them high

721
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,120
dosages to be an effective treatment

722
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,640
against the cancer but then we often

723
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,640
have to hold back because of what the

724
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,880
patient can tolerate right

725
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,960
both in terms of like quality of life

726
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,279
tolerate but also in terms of literally

727
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,360
too much could actually end up killing

728
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,720
them if it's just you know

729
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,200
constantly eroding at their gut and

730
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,960
constantly eroding at their ability to

731
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,159
produce blood cells um

732
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,679
if there are any questions just let me

733
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,640
know let's talk a little bit

734
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,120
about newer treatments so we talked

735
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,720
about surgery

736
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,400
radiation chemotherapy let's talk about

737
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,720
targeted therapy right because i think

738
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,679
one thing we can

739
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,200
realize with chemo is that it's just

740
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,520
sort of this um

741
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,440
it's sort of this like shotgun spray

742
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,760
like it's a very aggressive

743
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,840
treatment and it kind of just hits

744
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,840
there's all of this collateral damage

745
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,760
that's going on because of the nature of

746
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,960
chemo it's like

747
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,120
to kill cancer we're going to target dna

748
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,880
it's like well that's a feature shared

749
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,080
with all cells

750
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,640
so that's kind of a problematic approach

751
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,799
so targeted therapy is trying to be

752
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,000
a little more um like you know narrow

753
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,159
the scope look for a specific feature

754
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:00,960
that maybe is

755
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,679
more unique to cancer cells or again is

756
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:04,960
something that just

757
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,360
doesn't hit literally every cell in the

758
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,159
body

759
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,080
and so targeted therapy the real goal

760
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,440
there is that um

761
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,240
by being more specific you just limit

762
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,200
the amount of

763
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,520
um you know side effects that the

764
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,600
patient has to deal with and maybe you

765
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,159
can then

766
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,159
up the dosage because the side effects

767
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,080
are more tolerable it's less harmful to

768
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,039
the body

769
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,120
and again you can then be more

770
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,960
aggressive towards the cancer itself

771
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,080
yeah in terms of thinking how to

772
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,679
personalize

773
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,919
um i would say that there are cases

774
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,799
where you can imagine that

775
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,240
um when making

776
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,240
i mean it's such a tough question when

777
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,600
you're like how much chemo do i give

778
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,559
this patient right

779
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,400
and you're taking into account all of

780
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,919
these features about their current

781
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:54,640
health

782
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,240
but you're trying to make a prediction

783
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,520
right because you don't want to be in

784
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,480
the case where you

785
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,200
went real easy on the chemo and it

786
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,039
actually wasn't super effective and the

787
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,600
patient's cancer just kept growing

788
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,520
kept spreading right like that that is

789
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,360
such a uh

790
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,600
a terrible position to be in to realize

791
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,279
oh i should have been more aggressive

792
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,760
because the cancer was continuing to get

793
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,840
worse in the meantime um so in that

794
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,000
sense

795
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,480
having more data to influence that just

796
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,600
that choice to be like

797
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,919
okay because of everything we know about

798
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,600
you whether that be

799
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,760
the sequencing the genetics of your

800
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,000
cancer or some other data just like

801
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
knowing your circumstances and other

802
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,159
patients who are like you if that could

803
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,440
tell us

804
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,200
yes it's really difficult but we just

805
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,720
have to be more aggressive

806
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,440
up front like we know that if we don't

807
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,600
chances are very likely that it just

808
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,000
we might as well not treat it all i

809
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,840
think that kind of information could be

810
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,120
very useful because

811
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,520
currently yeah it's a regretful position

812
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,440
to be in if you

813
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,919
kind of ease up on the chemo but it just

814
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:58,960
ultimately isn't

815
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,399
helping the patient at all right like

816
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:01,840
you don't want to have them go through

817
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,480
the

818
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,360
the stress of chemo and not have it add

819
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,640
additional

820
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,559
you know quality time in their life um

821
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,559
i will speak a bit in general about how

822
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,880
chemo doesn't tend to be curative

823
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,960
for most patients usually the

824
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,039
conversation that's being had is how

825
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,840
much can we add to their life like

826
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,960
chances are

827
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,960
if it's a very late stage cancer they

828
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,360
will probably die to that cancer

829
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,720
but you're hoping that you can add

830
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,399
several months or maybe even

831
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,559
a couple of years to their remaining

832
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,360
life by treating with chemo

833
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,559
so that's kind of the trade-off it's

834
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:37,840
like you don't want to give them chemo

835
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,399
and have them

836
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,039
suffer and not actually add any time to

837
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,240
their life

838
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,039
so if we had the data to know based on

839
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,720
this patient based on the features of

840
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,799
their tumor based on their

841
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,120
their patient level features we know we

842
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,039
should be more aggressive or

843
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,960
less aggressive like don't make them

844
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,720
suffer chemo if it's not going to help

845
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,159
them in the end that's the kind of

846
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,440
decisions you might want to make

847
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,640
all right so let's talk a little bit

848
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,320
about targeted therapy

849
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,399
um so targeted therapy is something

850
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:09,760
that's thrown around a lot

851
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,799
it actually isn't super new in the sense

852
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:13,120
of

853
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,399
we discovered some really early targeted

854
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,080
therapies just based on our

855
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,200
understanding

856
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,919
of um normal human biology

857
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,919
and that helped us discover some

858
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,200
particularly useful

859
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,440
targets but since those early

860
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,200
discoveries a lot of the target

861
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,039
therapies we've discovered have to be

862
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,600
more involved like we've had to turn to

863
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,799
big data to

864
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,000
discover new targets so the classical

865
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,159
targets for targeted therapy were

866
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,159
actually things that are related

867
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,200
to um hormones

868
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,640
and and sexual development so if you

869
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,760
think about what hormones do

870
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,880
in in like the typical human body

871
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,880
whether um biologically male or

872
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,440
biologically female the way a lot of sex

873
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,399
hormones work

874
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,799
is that when they sort of kick into gear

875
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,320
during puberty

876
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,039
they enact a ton of changes in the body

877
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:09,600
right

878
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,919
when these hormones sort of ramp up and

879
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,840
are being expressed more and they're

880
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,039
moving through the body

881
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,600
in people's teenage years it leads to

882
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,880
the development

883
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,880
of you know the sex organs but it's

884
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,080
basically

885
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,320
switching on all these pathways for a

886
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,120
lot of

887
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,520
tissue and cells to develop right it's

888
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,960
basically saying okay

889
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,399
time to create these new organs or

890
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,399
develop these organs and it basically

891
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,039
ramps up growth and it ramps up cell

892
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:37,679
division

893
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,399
in those tissues and so our bodies have

894
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:40,960
this sort of

895
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,960
natural programmed way by which you know

896
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,000
obviously as we

897
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,080
grow older we just like grow bigger and

898
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,640
taller but also that's like a very

899
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,360
key moment in our in our species

900
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,559
development where

901
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,200
we just suddenly will develop new

902
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,679
tissues and grow new tissues

903
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,159
and so there are lots of cancers that

904
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:00,880
arise

905
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,600
in sex organs that sort of hijack that

906
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,080
normal

907
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,880
process so for example in the uh in

908
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,559
breast cancer i mean in

909
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,519
normal woman development it's like when

910
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,120
the hormones start that actually

911
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,720
kick-starts the development of the

912
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,559
breast so like breast tissue starts to

913
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,640
divide and proliferate

914
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,600
and so when you have a breast cancer

915
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,679
it's actually using that pathway to sort

916
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:23,919
of

917
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,480
tell itself to keep growing and dividing

918
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,240
so it's like what happened in puberty to

919
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,760
lead to growth of that tissue

920
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,679
cancer is using that pathway to just

921
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,679
tell itself continuously to grow and

922
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,200
divide and so that's a very

923
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,720
precise pathway that's specific to

924
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,120
cells that relate to the sex organs it's

925
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,760
not

926
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,679
true of all cells right like not all

927
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:46,799
cells in your body

928
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,159
are using for example estrogen in that

929
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,039
way

930
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:54,159
and so when someone realized hey these

931
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,880
breast cancer tumors seem to be

932
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,200
expressing a lot of

933
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,360
estrogen receptor like they're they're

934
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,519
they're really responsive to this

935
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:04,640
hormone

936
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,760
um that made them realize oh if we block

937
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,399
this the signaling the messaging through

938
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,000
this hormone receptor

939
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,720
um so that it stops basically picking up

940
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,720
on any amount of estrogen and telling

941
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,320
itself divide divide forever keep

942
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,200
dividing

943
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,600
um if we block that it is something that

944
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,120
the tumor is very

945
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,240
reliant on like it really uses that uh

946
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,600
hormone receptor to power its ability to

947
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,640
keep dividing

948
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,240
but that's not true of all of the

949
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,159
healthy cells i mean it's true of some

950
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,080
of the healthy cells like there are some

951
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,000
normal cells especially in a woman's

952
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,200
body that do

953
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,760
respond to estrogen but it's not true of

954
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,360
literally every cell in her body right

955
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,840
literally every cell in her body has dna

956
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,600
so if we target dna that's a huge

957
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,840
problem but if we target this estrogen

958
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,960
receptor it's just

959
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,840
more specific the the the eligible

960
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,200
population is a lot

961
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,159
smaller of who would be affected and so

962
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,240
that's what they basically did was they

963
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,440
created what we call these estrogen

964
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,720
blockers

965
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,440
an example of that is tamoxifen so

966
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,120
tamoxifen is something that

967
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,960
kind of looks like estrogen

968
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,799
and when it's flowing through someone's

969
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,640
body if someone's undergoing

970
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,240
treatment for breast cancer and they

971
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,760
know they have a cancer

972
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,120
that is reliant on estrogen which is not

973
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,000
true of every breast

974
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,440
cancer but if they test and they know

975
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,039
hey you have breast cancer and you

976
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,279
specifically have estrogen

977
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,600
dependent breast cancer it has a large

978
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,640
amount of this

979
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,799
estrogen receptor because it mutated in

980
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,720
a way to have tons of it

981
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,559
if they identify that about the tumor

982
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,840
then they know that they're a good

983
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,519
candidate for this specific

984
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,760
treatment this targeted therapy and so

985
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,760
you add the estrogen

986
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,799
mimic this tamoxifen it'll bind to the

987
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,399
estrogen receptor but it doesn't

988
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,200
actually send

989
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,360
the signal it basically blocks the

990
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,120
ability of that receptor to

991
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,840
respond to normal estrogen because it's

992
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,440
kind of sitting in its spot

993
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,679
and blocking their ability to talk to

994
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,200
each other

995
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,640
and so generally speaking if there's a

996
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,480
cancer again that's really reliant on

997
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,079
this estrogen signaling

998
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,000
it can no longer send those signals and

999
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,679
chances are its ability to

1000
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,560
divide and grow will be stalled and in

1001
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,839
some cases without that

1002
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:22,079
kind of uh continuous

1003
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,520
encouragement the cells might also die

1004
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,199
this is maybe one thing that isn't super

1005
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,719
apparent about cells but

1006
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,480
if you ever go on to study and research

1007
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,679
cell biology um we grow lots of cells

1008
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,639
in cultures and dishes but that's not

1009
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,159
actually very typical of

1010
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,159
normal cells generally speaking if you

1011
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,320
extract cells from a person and put them

1012
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,199
in a dish

1013
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,839
they won't grow because they don't have

1014
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,440
the environment they expect

1015
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,359
and the environment they expect is both

1016
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,280
the interactions with their neighboring

1017
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,079
cells

1018
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,320
who like tell them reassuring things but

1019
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,200
there's also

1020
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,400
like um signals that our bodies produce

1021
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,240
that sort of flow everywhere

1022
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,280
that help reassure ourselves basically

1023
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,640
i i don't know how to describe this

1024
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,240
other than saying like our cells get

1025
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,119
really lonely

1026
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,640
like if you just extract the cell and

1027
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,240
put in a dish without

1028
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,400
all of the messaging that it expects and

1029
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,520
all of the communication with its

1030
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,119
neighbors those cells will actually die

1031
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,079
because they don't

1032
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,680
have that constant messaging around them

1033
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,760
so cancer cells can be similar where you

1034
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,200
sort of starve

1035
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,040
the messaging that they're expecting and

1036
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,839
they'll actually die without that

1037
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:31,040
messaging

1038
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,960
and so we have used this very

1039
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,119
effectively again specifically in

1040
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:35,839
patients

1041
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,040
who use estrogen receptor um

1042
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,280
so if they we test their tumor and we're

1043
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,800
like oh your tumor is

1044
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,880
dependent on estrogen it has a lot of

1045
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,960
this receptor being expressed

1046
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,359
those patients will do very well with

1047
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,359
tamoxifen with these this particular

1048
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,240
therapy

1049
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,920
if they don't express a lot of this

1050
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,680
estrogen receptor their tumor

1051
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,800
isn't using the estrogen pathway and so

1052
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,880
the the treatment doesn't make any

1053
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,240
difference to them

1054
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,119
and so at the diagnosis stage you would

1055
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,119
diagnose someone for example a woman

1056
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:07,440
with

1057
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,839
breast cancer but you would also then

1058
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:10,800
genotype you

1059
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,680
test the genetics of her tumor to figure

1060
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,560
out is she

1061
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,839
er positive is she dependent on estrogen

1062
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:21,359
or is she not in terms of her tumor

1063
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:22,640
and i just want to say this has been

1064
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,040
really powerful because for some women

1065
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,800
who we anticipate might be very

1066
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,240
sensitive to developing breast cancer

1067
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,839
you can actually give these women

1068
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:39,040
tamoxifen preemptively as a preventative

1069
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,960
measure so before they even get breast

1070
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,720
cancer if a woman

1071
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,880
because of her family history or her

1072
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,200
lifestyle or other factors if a woman is

1073
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:47,599
very

1074
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,480
likely to develop a severe breast cancer

1075
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,320
you can tell her to take tamoxifen

1076
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,320
early and she just will be less likely

1077
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,720
to to develop it in her lifetime

1078
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,119
so this is a very effective and again

1079
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,800
targeted therapy it's not like there's

1080
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,920
no side effects

1081
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,720
but the side effects are less severe

1082
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,680
compared to

1083
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,760
a treatment that literally targets all

1084
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,160
dna

1085
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,960
are there any other questions up until

1086
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,440
this point

1087
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,200
okay

1088
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,960
all right so let's talk a bit about

1089
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,599
discovering new targeted therapies

1090
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,040
um and so i'm gonna walk you through

1091
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,720
this diagram and explain what it's

1092
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,440
showing

1093
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,560
but i'm gonna just give you a couple of

1094
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,160
ways that we've sort of tried to

1095
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:36,880
discover

1096
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,960
new targeted therapies because again you

1097
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,880
can imagine in the prior case with the

1098
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,800
woman who has breast cancer if we

1099
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,440
test her her cancer and we realize oh

1100
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,960
it's estrogen dependent

1101
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,040
we've created this new option for her

1102
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,040
right she might be very responsive to

1103
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,160
tamoxifen

1104
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,000
but imagine the patients who test

1105
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,680
negative like what do we tell them they

1106
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,320
basically

1107
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,560
don't have that option it's harder to

1108
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,000
treat their cancer so we're trying to

1109
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,280
think about what is

1110
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,520
what is true about their tumor that

1111
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,200
gives us a new way to treat

1112
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,200
them specifically that maybe isn't true

1113
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,560
of the women who

1114
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,359
use tamoxifen instead so we're trying to

1115
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:14,160
discover these new targeted therapies um

1116
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,680
the ones involving hormones were a

1117
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,280
little easier because it was

1118
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,560
it it leveraged what we already knew

1119
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,200
about how

1120
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,960
certain tissues work especially those

1121
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,640
related to sex organs

1122
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,720
but now everything else is sort of more

1123
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,000
of like this open

1124
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,640
search for anything that might be the

1125
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,760
achilles heel of a given cancer

1126
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,680
and so there's a couple ways we think

1127
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,359
about identifying

1128
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,560
um new targeted therapies so one thing i

1129
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,280
will mention

1130
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,040
is when we're thinking about targeted

1131
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,119
therapies you can imagine and i think i

1132
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,000
showed the inner

1133
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,880
ring last time in terms of a diagram is

1134
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,800
that there's all of these

1135
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,320
facets of cancer part of cancer is that

1136
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,960
it you know is able to divide forever

1137
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,560
part of cancer is that it's able to

1138
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,480
invade and metastasize

1139
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,560
another part of cancer is that things

1140
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,560
that would normally trigger a healthy

1141
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,560
cell to die such as you know breaking

1142
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,359
the rules

1143
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:10,400
um or not enough food to go around

1144
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,119
cancer cells have evolved to overcome

1145
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:13,680
that

1146
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,920
messaging and so they're able to resist

1147
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,880
cell death

1148
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,720
and so all of those that inner ring is

1149
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,720
showing these traits that are

1150
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,520
true of cancer cells and so what's being

1151
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,520
shown along the outer ring

1152
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,839
is showing examples of treatments that

1153
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:28,880
are basically trying to

1154
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,720
target that feature so for example if

1155
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,119
cancer cells are able to invade and

1156
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,560
metastasize

1157
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,480
there might be an inhibitor of a

1158
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,079
specific protein or

1159
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,440
enzyme that has a role in

1160
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,680
cells ability to move around or a cell's

1161
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,599
ability to go from one place

1162
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,320
and like land and survive that journey

1163
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,880
and land in another tissue

1164
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,160
so what's being shown around the outer

1165
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,000
ring are examples of targeted

1166
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,839
drugs that are aimed at that trait

1167
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:03,119
like if cells if cancer cells can change

1168
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,880
their metabolism let's target their

1169
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,440
ability

1170
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,000
to change their metabolism and so that's

1171
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,560
sort of

1172
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:13,040
one very targeted approach

1173
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,440
yeah sahil that's a great question do we

1174
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,520
layer targeted drugs on top of each

1175
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:17,920
other

1176
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,119
um we do we absolutely do um

1177
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,960
so one thing that might not have been

1178
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,400
obvious from

1179
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,079
um from that first slide i showed

1180
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,920
you actually let me go back to it very

1181
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,119
briefly

1182
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,640
um from this sort of staging diagram and

1183
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,079
thinking about the treatments

1184
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,800
something that might be not so obvious

1185
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,440
is that

1186
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,000
there are times where we kind of will

1187
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,760
try one treatment and then when that

1188
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,520
doesn't work we just go to the next one

1189
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,200
so that's a lot of this sort of first

1190
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,440
line second line is deciding oh you know

1191
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,040
we'll try this first if that doesn't

1192
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,160
work we'll go to the next

1193
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,440
option but there are cases where

1194
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,680
um we've done research and we realized

1195
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,520
certain things are really effective

1196
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,359
in conjunction with each other and

1197
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,880
assuming that

1198
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,720
two drugs which generally speaking then

1199
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,400
brings two different sets of side

1200
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:06,960
effects

1201
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,280
if those still are tolerable there are

1202
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,440
cases where we know that the combination

1203
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,960
is more effective

1204
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,440
um and we will actually talk about why

1205
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,200
we tend towards combinations

1206
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,319
um there's sort of like a a theoretical

1207
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,640
reason why combinations do really work

1208
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,720
well um that we'll talk about but yeah

1209
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,880
we there are cases where we just sort of

1210
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,400
go from one to the next and i think that

1211
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,160
tends to be where

1212
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,800
the two together are intolerable or um

1213
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,040
there's still this hope oh if this one

1214
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,800
really works we don't even like we can

1215
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,160
save that other option

1216
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,160
till later so that we just have more

1217
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,440
options so like

1218
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,560
let's exhaust this one first um yeah but

1219
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,599
there is a lot of research where

1220
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:48,000
clinical

1221
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,560
trials are just basically like let's try

1222
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,520
a plus b

1223
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,240
or let's try a plus b plus c um that's

1224
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,680
definitely something that's always

1225
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,480
being researched

1226
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,960
all right um i think i will actually

1227
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,839
skip this next one and go to here

1228
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:07,760
because i think this is very relevant to

1229
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,640
how

1230
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,079
when you're when you are someone who's

1231
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,160
very data oriented i think

1232
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,599
this mean this strategy of identifying

1233
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,240
targeted therapies might resonate a lot

1234
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,960
which is to say there's been a lot of

1235
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,599
work

1236
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,720
where people as they are

1237
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,920
collecting all of these different tumor

1238
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,560
samples

1239
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,319
and sequencing all of them they're

1240
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:31,920
really interested in okay well what

1241
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,520
mutations are really

1242
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,480
common either across all cancers or in

1243
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,000
certain types of cancer so if you

1244
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,760
collected a lot of different

1245
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,200
lung tumors what is like the

1246
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,599
general profile of a lung tumor what

1247
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,280
tends to be mutated

1248
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,680
um and the idea is that if you identify

1249
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,400
certain things that

1250
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,040
tend to be mutated you would think okay

1251
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:53,760
well then

1252
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,680
is that a target if there's something

1253
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,599
that's mutated and often is like

1254
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,160
acting abnormally in cancer if i target

1255
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:00,880
it

1256
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,520
um specifically like the mutant or the

1257
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,200
overactive version

1258
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,800
that might be an option for treatment

1259
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,599
for can for patients who test positive

1260
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,680
for that mutation as well

1261
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,040
and i want to be clear that's not true

1262
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,599
of all patients so for example here you

1263
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:16,079
can see

1264
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,200
this was true of like 13

1265
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,280
of patients but the idea is that you can

1266
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,440
imagine oh if a patient comes into the

1267
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,680
clinic we might test for this one

1268
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,920
this one and this one and you know

1269
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,720
together

1270
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,680
that might account for 30 to 40 to 50

1271
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,200
percent of patients

1272
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,520
have at least one of them and so we

1273
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,880
might test them for all of these

1274
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,960
mutations to then point to like

1275
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,520
should you take drug a or drug b or drug

1276
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,720
c that target each of these mutations

1277
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,240
and so there's been a lot of work where

1278
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,800
we've sequenced so many tumors to try to

1279
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,400
basically be able to develop

1280
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,200
like hey a subset of lung cancer

1281
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,079
patients are eligible

1282
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,000
for this we've developed a drug that now

1283
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,520
targets this so we'll

1284
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,200
we'll genotype them when they get

1285
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,160
diagnosed to point them to this therapy

1286
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,839
so this is something that has happened a

1287
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,760
lot as long as we've

1288
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,359
had sequencing available and been

1289
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,280
sequencing tumors we've been working on

1290
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,200
trying to figure out

1291
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,560
what mutations are targets

1292
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,240
but i wanted to be very clear though

1293
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,359
that all of these different options

1294
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:22,960
don't tend to work so well in practice

1295
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,040
um generally speaking once a patient is

1296
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:27,680
at

1297
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,599
a later stage so the cancer has

1298
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,200
metastasized

1299
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,040
i think i forgot to emphasize this but

1300
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,800
when you're at a later stage

1301
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,160
in in cancer and the cancer has spread

1302
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,680
we often use a lot of these therapies

1303
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,119
like these targeted therapies or

1304
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,119
chemotherapies because the idea is that

1305
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,280
they go throughout the entire body

1306
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,599
right when you're a patient who's being

1307
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,040
given cisplatin

1308
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,040
um you'll get it usually for like an iv

1309
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,280
drip or maybe you take a pill

1310
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,040
that sort of just goes throughout your

1311
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,560
whole body like it's flowing

1312
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,640
in your blood going throughout your

1313
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,599
whole body

1314
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,599
and the idea is you take those types of

1315
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:04,640
treatments those

1316
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,200
systemic treatments because your cancer

1317
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,560
spreads such that

1318
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,160
yeah we know that there's a tumor and we

1319
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,160
can you know target that tumor

1320
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,079
but the cancer cells could kind of be

1321
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,760
anywhere and so you're taking the

1322
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,520
systemic treatment to hopefully kill

1323
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,800
the cells wherever they might be

1324
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,319
hopefully you'll hit the tumor cells

1325
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,480
wherever they have ended up

1326
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,440
and so later stage patients usually what

1327
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:27,839
we

1328
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,000
point them to is chemotherapy or a

1329
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,760
targeted therapy they might be eligible

1330
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,319
for

1331
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:33,680
because it will go throughout their

1332
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,079
whole body but again these are patients

1333
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:36,400
who

1334
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,520
are at those later stages surgery was

1335
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,359
not a curative option for them so we

1336
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:43,200
point them to chemo or we point them to

1337
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,240
targeted therapy

1338
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,079
but i will just say again i mentioned

1339
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,319
this this doesn't tend to be curative

1340
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:51,440
it's more like it buys them more time

1341
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,920
um generally speaking we tend to see

1342
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,440
curves like this one

1343
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,040
what this curve is showing you is sort

1344
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,680
of out of a total number of patients how

1345
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,760
many were still alive after a certain

1346
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,440
point of time when they've been

1347
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,280
um when they've been diagnosed

1348
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,040
they've tried the localized treatments

1349
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,839
and then they get on a targeted therapy

1350
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,119
um or a chemotherapy what you can see is

1351
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,040
that all of the curves collapsed to zero

1352
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:17,520
right

1353
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,839
ultimately all of the patients in both

1354
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:20,560
cohorts

1355
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,560
died but what happened to the patients

1356
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,319
who got the targeted therapy

1357
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:27,119
versus the ones who didn't is that it

1358
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,079
was shifted

1359
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:29,760
so we've shifted the curve to the right

1360
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,079
which just means that they get more time

1361
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,480
they get some number of months and lucky

1362
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,000
cases they get some number of years

1363
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,599
where they continue to survive but

1364
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:38,640
ultimately

1365
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,240
it doesn't cure them of their cancer

1366
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,000
and i'll just say that the closest we've

1367
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,520
come to that so far

1368
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,760
has been things like immunotherapy which

1369
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,359
is where a lot of the excitement has

1370
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:50,319
come from

1371
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:51,680
and so i'm just going to compare these

1372
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,599
two curves which is

1373
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:55,680
on this side it's as you've seen here

1374
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,920
where it's like there's a shift

1375
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,000
there's a shift but ultimately both of

1376
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,040
them collapse

1377
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,680
to zero and so in both cases all

1378
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,400
patients

1379
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,400
die it's just a matter of some of them

1380
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,079
get more time

1381
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:09,680
what's being shown here on the right and

1382
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,240
this is in the case of immunotherapy

1383
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,480
is um you don't necessarily see this

1384
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,359
shift

1385
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:18,240
but there are a subset of patients again

1386
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,160
what this is showing here is of the

1387
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,880
hundred percent of patients who were in

1388
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,720
the cohort originally

1389
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,040
if all of them die the curve collapses

1390
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,480
down to zero

1391
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,400
but what you'll see here is that this

1392
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,160
curve actually doesn't collapse all the

1393
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,440
way to zero so this is

1394
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,079
shown here in the purple this doesn't

1395
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,079
collapse to zero and so there's a subset

1396
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:39,839
of patients who just keep

1397
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:42,960
living and so for them essentially

1398
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,760
they've been cured or they're like they

1399
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,359
they are sort of the exception

1400
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:48,960
versus everyone else who they had more

1401
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,880
time but they never they still ended up

1402
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,680
dying

1403
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,000
these patients just keep living and it's

1404
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,280
not all of them

1405
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,240
it doesn't work for all of them but this

1406
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,760
in and of itself is just a

1407
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,160
change in what we've tended to expect

1408
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,920
right with every additional treatment

1409
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,440
it's kind of been like oh i can shift it

1410
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,720
even more but it still collapses to zero

1411
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,319
that's been the dichotomy that we've

1412
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:11,760
been used to is

1413
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,680
the original curve versus a shifted

1414
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,079
curve and how far we shift it

1415
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:18,000
versus thinking about are there patients

1416
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,240
that just keep living

1417
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,760
so that's been a lot of the excitement

1418
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,839
around chemotherapy but i did want to

1419
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:24,480
touch on

1420
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,839
why some patients or why is it so hard

1421
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:28,880
to cure patients

1422
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,559
why is it that with all of these

1423
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,559
targeted therapies ultimately all

1424
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,240
patients still die

1425
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,119
um sorry i should be clear that's not

1426
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,040
the case in literally every cancer there

1427
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,319
are some cancers where we

1428
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,240
can cure them with target therapy it's

1429
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,720
just that tends to be the exception

1430
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,640
rather than the other way around so

1431
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,480
rather than saying oh target therapy is

1432
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,760
cure most patients but there's some

1433
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,319
patients who

1434
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:52,079
can't help it tends to be that target

1435
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:53,520
therapies

1436
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,119
don't cure most patients but there are a

1437
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,359
couple of exceptions where it does

1438
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,920
um and so some of you may have heard of

1439
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,880
there's this drug

1440
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,000
called uh glebec and it is specifically

1441
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,559
used in a type of blood cancer i believe

1442
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,880
the cancer is used in this cml

1443
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,559
and so in that very particular type of

1444
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:12,720
cancer for patients who are eligible for

1445
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,240
that targeted therapy

1446
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,400
it actually works really really well

1447
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,160
like a lot of those patients tend to be

1448
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,359
cured or survive many years um some of

1449
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:22,640
them might relapse

1450
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,400
after a long period of time but there

1451
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,079
are some patients who just seem to keep

1452
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,000
living with this drug

1453
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,920
um so i don't want to say like it

1454
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,680
literally never works i would just say

1455
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,440
by and large and especially for a lot of

1456
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,359
the most common types of cancer like

1457
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:38,480
lung cancer or breast cancer or cancer

1458
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,240
of the brain

1459
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,720
we tend to see this type of pattern more

1460
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,599
where

1461
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,119
you know it helps for a while but it

1462
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,520
ultimately can't cure them

1463
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,040
um and i just want to talk about why

1464
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,720
that is and really

1465
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,119
the theoretical point of view for why

1466
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:54,079
this is the case

1467
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:57,280
is actually evolution so you may have

1468
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,200
learned about evolution in the context

1469
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,800
of like species of things like

1470
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,760
animals or plants or people or bacteria

1471
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,880
and the idea is that

1472
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,240
with evolution these

1473
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,640
different populations of living things

1474
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,000
like i think the common example is like

1475
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
oh the gazelle and the gazelle needs to

1476
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,599
outrun the lion

1477
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,079
um and the idea is oh the gazelle would

1478
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:20,800
evolve

1479
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,240
ways to be able to better elude the lion

1480
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,839
right so they can survive and they can

1481
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:27,680
reproduce and so if there's

1482
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,000
a way they can evolve better camouflage

1483
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,359
if they can evolve to run

1484
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,440
faster all of those things would

1485
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,200
contribute to them being more likely to

1486
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,000
survive

1487
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,640
attacks by lion and so their genetics

1488
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,559
sort of slowly evolve over time to

1489
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:41,200
select

1490
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,000
for if a mutation arises that like leads

1491
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,079
to a coat that's harder for the lion to

1492
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:46,640
see

1493
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,440
that gets selected for and that becomes

1494
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,520
more common in the population of gazelle

1495
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,000
because that

1496
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,920
gazelle basically lives when whereas

1497
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,200
others might die

1498
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,480
and they pass on that mutation um cancer

1499
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,800
works very similarly in the sense of you

1500
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,319
have to think of it as

1501
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:06,000
a tumor is a collection of cells

1502
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,720
each cell has its own dna granted they

1503
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,119
all

1504
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,200
originated from your body so they share

1505
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,720
a lot of dna

1506
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,839
but as cancers start to become cancerous

1507
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,920
they're basically accumulating mutations

1508
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,839
and each cell is its own

1509
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:22,640
agent like each cell may have come from

1510
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,440
another cell

1511
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,079
but during the lifetime of that cell

1512
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,200
they can continue

1513
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,480
to mutate because of you know the cancer

1514
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,240
cells just make a lot of mistakes

1515
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,839
the cancer cells are being exposed to

1516
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:36,720
all of these dna mutating

1517
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,599
substances um and so each cell is kind

1518
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:40,240
of like its

1519
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,880
own agent that is unlike that is

1520
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,920
undergoing changes

1521
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,960
and if an uh mutation arises in one of

1522
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:47,760
those cells

1523
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,720
that is advantageous it becomes selected

1524
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,319
for

1525
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:55,200
so when we're thinking of a cancer

1526
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,160
cancers arise from a single cell

1527
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,880
that accumulates some mutations and

1528
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,319
generally leads to that cell

1529
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,319
growing and dividing more than it's

1530
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:05,520
supposed to

1531
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,800
and when it grows and divides more than

1532
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,880
it's supposed to it ends up creating a

1533
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,119
population right because that growth

1534
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:12,640
all of the cells that descended from

1535
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,640
that growth there's a collection of them

1536
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,760
right and each of those has a chance to

1537
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,720
mutate

1538
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,880
so in this collection there might be a

1539
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,079
certain cell that

1540
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:25,040
randomly gets a mutation that allows it

1541
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,720
to then do something that it was

1542
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,640
unable to do before so for example this

1543
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,079
could allow it to

1544
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,200
invade physically into a new space that

1545
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,599
it couldn't survive in before

1546
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:38,880
and as it invades it you know makes a

1547
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,319
home in that new space

1548
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,319
it continues to grow and divide and so

1549
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:43,920
it again it creates this

1550
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,359
population of cells and each cell

1551
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:50,640
has a chance to divide and each cell has

1552
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,440
a chance to

1553
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,720
mutate and so if it mutates it can gain

1554
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,160
a new ability

1555
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,880
it can become selected for and again

1556
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,720
create its own new population so it

1557
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,720
basically just continues to evolve from

1558
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,680
there

1559
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,200
and that's what we actually see when we

1560
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,079
try to treat so this tx basically stands

1561
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:09,599
for treatment

1562
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,880
um when we're treating basically at that

1563
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,240
point in time

1564
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,559
let me clear this so when we're treating

1565
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:17,920
at that point in time

1566
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,960
we see this sort of collection of cells

1567
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,960
that makes up the tumor and it's a very

1568
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,480
diverse collection which is

1569
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,680
what's being shown with all these

1570
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,000
different colors and when we're trying

1571
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,839
to treat them we're trying to kill all

1572
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,240
of them and maybe we're very

1573
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,720
successful at killing most of these but

1574
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:35,680
maybe there is

1575
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,559
one cell that has mutation that means it

1576
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:40,559
doesn't respond to the treatment

1577
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:43,280
we've killed all of its competition that

1578
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,599
cell is selected for it is the one

1579
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,880
gazelle that outran the lion and so left

1580
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,880
to its own devices it basically keeps

1581
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,559
dividing and all of its

1582
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:55,280
uh cells that it creates all carry that

1583
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,200
resistance mutation

1584
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,880
and so that's what we tend to see in

1585
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,960
cancer is that we'll treat

1586
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,520
um with a targeted therapy the tumor

1587
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,280
looks like it's responding because it'll

1588
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,960
generally stop growing it might even

1589
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:07,839
regress

1590
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:09,280
so the tumor looks like it's getting

1591
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,960
smaller and smaller

1592
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,200
but then at some point we sort of killed

1593
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,119
all of the cells that were sensitive to

1594
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:15,920
the drug

1595
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,280
but there might be some number of cells

1596
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,680
that have a resistance mutation

1597
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,760
and so at that point they don't shrink

1598
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,720
any further

1599
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,559
and actually they start to grow back

1600
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,960
because the drug makes no difference

1601
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,480
them they basically don't see

1602
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,480
or don't respond to the drug so we see

1603
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,760
that with patients where the tumor

1604
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:34,960
regresses

1605
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,920
stops responding and it starts regrowing

1606
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:38,480
and that is

1607
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,079
very typical because basically their

1608
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:44,240
cancer has evolved at that point

1609
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,760
are there any questions about that

1610
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,880
so my question is again refer back to

1611
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,119
the kovi situation we know the

1612
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:58,400
rna keeps on mutate mutating

1613
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,880
yes so are we eventually going to face

1614
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,400
this kind of dilemma

1615
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,280
because of this mutation the current

1616
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,040
vaccine may not work

1617
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,799
so you mentioned about the shape of uh

1618
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:15,119
the the virus may be the same but

1619
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:18,640
who knows i i i don't have any

1620
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,280
information to do any prediction yeah i

1621
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,319
mean that's a really interesting

1622
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:22,799
question

1623
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:25,119
i will say one thing to keep in mind is

1624
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:26,960
generally speaking

1625
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,240
the repertoire that a virus has to work

1626
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:30,960
with

1627
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,599
tends to be a bit smaller than a cancer

1628
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:34,000
cell

1629
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,079
right like a cancer cell basically has

1630
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:38,079
all of the genes that you do and then

1631
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:38,960
starts to like

1632
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,040
use them in very creative ways right

1633
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,720
like it takes your existing genes and

1634
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,160
maybe expresses them in new

1635
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,520
configurations

1636
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,200
or mutates them so it's expressing like

1637
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,160
a different version um

1638
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,599
viruses have a much smaller genomes

1639
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,440
so they generally speaking have a little

1640
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,760
less to work with like the amount they

1641
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:58,720
can mutate

1642
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,440
and kind of change what we're working

1643
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,640
with is smaller

1644
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,280
um i think what more people tend to be

1645
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,200
worried about and what leads to really

1646
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,400
big issues is when

1647
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,599
viruses sort of combine um

1648
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:14,960
so i'm trying to think of the picture

1649
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,880
there's this really great picture of it

1650
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,400
actually let me just

1651
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,119
try to show it

1652
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,760
um so there's this really great picture

1653
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,200
so when you're thinking about a virus

1654
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,079
right

1655
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:27,920
um and i'm just gonna draw like spikes

1656
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,920
on the outside because this is basically

1657
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,160
the spikes are important because the

1658
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,760
spikes are basically how

1659
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,559
if it runs into a human cell it's

1660
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:37,359
basically

1661
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:39,119
looking for something on the human cell

1662
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:41,119
that it can

1663
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:43,839
grab onto and is the means by which it

1664
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:44,880
invades

1665
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,000
so if this is a virus if this protein

1666
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,200
is specific to this feature and this

1667
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,359
tends to be the case for kovid that it's

1668
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:56,400
something that's common in your lungs

1669
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,000
it basically can bind to that and that's

1670
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,400
its entry route is that it it binds to

1671
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,400
those types of cells and it enters right

1672
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,200
so someone who's getting infected by a

1673
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,280
virus it's like oh just having the virus

1674
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,640
interact with your skin

1675
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,240
for example isn't enough because the

1676
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,400
thing it binds to isn't on your skin

1677
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,960
it's a specific feature on your cells

1678
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,880
that are common in your lungs or in your

1679
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:17,760
like

1680
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,720
the track to leading to your lungs um so

1681
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,440
what i'll say

1682
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,559
is that the amount of genetics that's in

1683
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:25,040
here

1684
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,359
tends to be pretty limited for viruses

1685
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:28,640
compared to cells

1686
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,599
so first off that just means like

1687
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:33,520
probability wise if you're dealing with

1688
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,280
something i don't actually know how long

1689
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,400
the covid

1690
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,640
genome is like just compared to human

1691
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,240
where it's like oh we have you know

1692
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,040
three

1693
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,319
billion bases to work with it's much

1694
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:45,359
shorter

1695
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:47,599
for actually let me look it up copied

1696
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,480
genome length

1697
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,760
um it is thirty

1698
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:58,799
thousand three thousand thirty k

1699
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:01,200
so compared to three billion it's a lot

1700
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,079
smaller

1701
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:05,440
um and so the amount that it can mutate

1702
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,240
tends to be

1703
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,319
quite limited like it doesn't sort of

1704
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:09,920
have as many of the endless

1705
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,000
possibilities for what it can do

1706
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,920
i think the thing to also consider is

1707
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,040
that

1708
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,960
i think there's a lot of concern around

1709
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,240
it mutating

1710
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,520
these outer proteins so that what

1711
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,920
our immune cells right our immune cells

1712
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,799
are supposed to develop these receptors

1713
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:30,480
that can find these viruses

1714
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,079
and the idea is if they change their

1715
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:33,839
spots then our immune cells can't do

1716
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:35,119
that anymore

1717
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,280
um but i think a thing to keep in mind

1718
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,200
is these outer proteins are

1719
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,359
serving a purpose for the virus like it

1720
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:43,920
literally can't change its spots to be

1721
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,160
any color any shape because at some

1722
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,240
point if it changes too much it actually

1723
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,599
can't bind to the lung

1724
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:53,119
cells anymore sorry i apologize if i can

1725
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:53,839
hear that

1726
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:56,319
um so i think that's a problem for the

1727
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:57,599
virus where it's like there are some

1728
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:59,040
mutations that might make it

1729
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:02,880
really good at evading our are prompted

1730
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,680
our vaccine immune response but that

1731
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,920
also might make it worse at infecting

1732
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,640
right or it might change who it infects

1733
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,920
um i mean i think that might be

1734
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,200
something to be concerned about is that

1735
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:13,680
if it

1736
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,760
somehow very effectively changes who it

1737
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,520
infects it just means that the like

1738
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,599
yes our vaccine won't work as well but i

1739
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:21,040
think also then the

1740
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,880
the disease it leads to will be

1741
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,040
different right like the disease we know

1742
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:28,000
is because it infects on lung cells so

1743
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,079
if that changes its target it's gonna be

1744
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:32,559
a different disease in some sense

1745
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:34,319
um so that's what i would keep in mind

1746
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:36,240
is just it's smaller it doesn't have

1747
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,799
like the potential to mutate literally

1748
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:40,319
in any way because it's kind of facing

1749
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:41,599
this trade-off

1750
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:43,520
it's like oh if it evades the immune

1751
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,520
destruction it just might also not be as

1752
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,680
good at being a virus

1753
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,680
uh those are the things i would consider

1754
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,680
i think one of the concerns people have

1755
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:52,319
had is

1756
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:55,599
what it's it's um it's something that

1757
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:56,400
happened

1758
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,280
with the i believe that's what happened

1759
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,640
with the 1918

1760
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,400
flu which is the concern of a

1761
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,799
co-infection that leads to exchange

1762
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:06,880
between two viruses

1763
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,760
so generally speaking when a cell a

1764
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:10,640
human cell

1765
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,760
or an animal cell is infected by

1766
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,160
two different virus particles at the

1767
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,599
same time

1768
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:19,920
um what can happen is the way these

1769
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,920
viruses often work is that they kind of

1770
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:22,720
just basically

1771
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:26,079
inject their genetic material into the

1772
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:28,400
cell and make the cell do what it wants

1773
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,240
and often what it wants is it wants the

1774
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,079
cell to become a factory to make more

1775
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:33,119
virus

1776
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:35,440
but if you have a co-infection so two

1777
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,760
different viruses at the same time

1778
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,480
their dna both gets plopped in here and

1779
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:41,760
in generally speaking

1780
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,559
it's not like it knows which dna came

1781
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:44,880
from

1782
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,520
who and so what can happen is you can

1783
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,359
end up with a virus that's kind of like

1784
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:53,280
a hybrid between these two viruses

1785
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,720
and i think that's something that people

1786
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,319
are concerned about with

1787
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,400
viruses in general not specific to cova

1788
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,839
just in general

1789
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:02,160
usually this hybrid virus can sometimes

1790
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,160
be the worst of both worlds

1791
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,760
so i think that's something that people

1792
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,680
might be concerned about

1793
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,319
but generally speaking like we deal with

1794
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:11,599
this with the flu

1795
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:14,319
every year is that it changes its spots

1796
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:15,119
enough

1797
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:18,799
that it avoids our vaccine response but

1798
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:20,559
i think there's only so much it can

1799
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:21,119
change

1800
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:24,480
that like i just don't know if

1801
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,319
covid variant in future years

1802
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:29,520
i don't know if we'll have endless

1803
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:30,960
variants or even then i don't know if

1804
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,559
the variance will just keep getting

1805
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:36,799
worse they just might be different um

1806
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:38,480
yeah i'm sorry i think it's very hard to

1807
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,880
say but those are just some of my early

1808
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:41,920
thoughts

1809
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:47,040
thank you so much yeah no problem um

1810
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,760
so let me see sorry i'm just looking

1811
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:53,839
ahead at stuff

1812
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:55,839
um i think this is a good place for just

1813
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,960
one well

1814
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,559
actually we go to 10 right

1815
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:06,799
is that accurate edward oh you're muted

1816
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:09,760
we we end at about 9 50 but we can't go

1817
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:10,240
to

1818
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,839
oh no no i don't i don't believe in

1819
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:14,079
keeping people beyond

1820
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:16,319
um so i'm trying to think about what

1821
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,559
would be more interesting for people

1822
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:21,359
to hear about are people more interested

1823
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:22,400
in hearing about

1824
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,480
immunotherapy or do they just want sort

1825
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,000
of an example

1826
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,119
of algorithms being used to guide

1827
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,599
treatments

1828
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:33,520
people can sort of either weigh in

1829
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,119
verbally or they can weigh in in the

1830
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:36,799
chat but they'd be more interested in

1831
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,559
immunotherapy or

1832
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:43,119
applications of ml in treatments

1833
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,799
all right i'm hearing applications of ml

1834
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:50,640
okay so let me give

1835
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:53,839
one example um

1836
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:58,079
that was actually research i worked on

1837
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,200
so let's go to

1838
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,799
here all right so let's talk a little

1839
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:08,640
bit about examples of this kind of

1840
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,960
research so again we face this really

1841
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,440
difficult issue where we have

1842
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,240
patience we're trying to figure out what

1843
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:17,760
therapies would work

1844
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,039
better in them often better just means

1845
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:23,280
longer survival times it doesn't often

1846
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:24,319
mean cures

1847
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:26,319
but even then we still think that's a

1848
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:28,720
worthwhile area to pursue

1849
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,640
and so i have several examples that are

1850
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,160
shown in my slides but i'm actually

1851
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,440
going to focus on the one

1852
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,480
that i worked on um so the one that i

1853
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,920
worked on

1854
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,920
um one thing i have to establish about

1855
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,440
the thing that i worked on

1856
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,640
is that we are dealing with sort of

1857
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:47,760
two levels of data in this data set what

1858
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,039
we have

1859
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:52,480
is um like first off what we have is

1860
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,039
basically a collection of cancer cells

1861
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:57,359
but what i'll tell you is that what can

1862
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:59,760
be the case for this type of data

1863
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,280
is that we're collecting single cell

1864
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,960
data where we basically measure and

1865
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:03,520
profile

1866
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,319
each individual cell but what you can

1867
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:09,039
imagine is when you're doing

1868
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:12,400
research on patients you can have

1869
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,000
this data collected from every single

1870
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,680
patient that you work with

1871
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,039
and so you have kind of two levels of

1872
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:20,720
data you have the level of data that's

1873
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,880
like each individual patient

1874
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,559
but then if you're collecting a sample

1875
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:26,559
from them and and uh

1876
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:29,680
characterizing their sample with

1877
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:32,720
single cell data you actually get

1878
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,559
two levels of individual there's the

1879
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:37,359
individual cell

1880
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:40,000
that came from an individual patient so

1881
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,359
there's a population of patients

1882
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:42,640
and for each patient they have their own

1883
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,160
population of cells that we're working

1884
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,039
with

1885
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:46,240
and so that's something that leads to a

1886
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,160
lot of interesting like

1887
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,480
multi-level problem solving where you're

1888
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:51,839
like oh i'm trying to

1889
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:54,319
predict something for the patient on the

1890
01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:57,200
basis of the diversity of cancer cells

1891
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,240
they have

1892
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:59,839
so if you're used to working with data

1893
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:01,359
where it's like oh for every single

1894
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:03,920
patient i have these rows

1895
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,920
and on the columns i have different

1896
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,000
features about them

1897
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,160
it actually becomes that this is a

1898
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,839
tabular data set you have

1899
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:14,240
for every single person each person has

1900
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,160
their own tabular data set for every

1901
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,559
cell that you collected from them

1902
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:20,960
and so again this is like a multi-level

1903
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,280
problem-solving step

1904
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:24,640
but i just want to give you a glimpse

1905
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,640
into how we deal with the single cell

1906
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,240
data so just like

1907
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,920
ignoring the individual we can't that it

1908
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,599
came from let's just focus on these

1909
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:33,280
single cells

1910
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,960
so i was working in a lab where we had a

1911
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,240
means by which we could take these cells

1912
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,280
and sample them and basically measure

1913
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,599
multiple features in each individual

1914
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:46,319
cell

1915
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:48,240
we were measuring it on the protein

1916
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,000
level so again we talked

1917
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,280
last time about like measuring their

1918
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,359
genetics measuring what their rna

1919
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:54,559
they're producing and then measuring the

1920
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:56,000
protein they've produced

1921
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,599
we were measuring protein they've

1922
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:00,400
produced so we took these cells

1923
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,319
and what we did is that we exposed them

1924
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:03,760
to a couple different

1925
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,720
treatments that are very commonly used

1926
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:07,920
to treat

1927
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,000
this particular type of cancer so the

1928
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,760
cancer i was dealing with is called

1929
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,480
multiple myeloma it is a cancer of the

1930
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:15,280
blood

1931
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,039
um so you would can't you would collect

1932
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:19,440
cells from their blood or from their

1933
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:20,799
bone marrow

1934
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:23,359
and so we take these cells and we expose

1935
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,240
them to the most

1936
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,160
common treatments that are used for this

1937
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:27,599
particular type of cancer because

1938
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:30,319
our interest was looking at different

1939
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:31,359
time points like

1940
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:34,480
before treatment during treatment

1941
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:35,599
sorry i'm gonna get rid of my little

1942
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:38,079
doodle um and after treatment

1943
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:40,559
we wanted to see okay what's happening

1944
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:41,119
like

1945
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:44,240
starting cells cells in progress of

1946
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,079
being exposed to drug and you know

1947
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:48,559
responding to that drug and then cells

1948
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:50,240
at the very end where it's kind of very

1949
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,920
clear that some cells have died and some

1950
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,520
cells have lived and so those

1951
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:56,240
living cells are resistant for some

1952
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,079
reason or another

1953
01:06:58,079 --> 01:06:59,839
and so we had a means by which we could

1954
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:02,400
collect cells at these different time

1955
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:03,200
points

1956
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:07,039
and measure up to 40 proteins

1957
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:09,599
in each individual cell so again the

1958
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:10,960
data format was like

1959
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,160
each row was a different cell collected

1960
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,680
at a different time points you have to

1961
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:16,160
remember

1962
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:19,200
each cell which time point it came from

1963
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,599
and then on the columns was like amount

1964
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:22,640
of protein a

1965
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,039
amount of protein b amount of protein c

1966
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:26,240
and so forth

1967
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,160
so that's the data set we collected you

1968
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:30,079
can imagine it's like a tabular data set

1969
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,039
of cells

1970
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:33,920
maybe for each separate time point in

1971
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,319
each separate treatment as well

1972
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:39,440
and what i was interested in doing um

1973
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,680
again methods wise it wasn't the most

1974
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,599
like sophisticated method but again

1975
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:45,119
we're always dealing with this trade-off

1976
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:46,640
where it's like the more complex the

1977
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,079
method is the more we don't actually

1978
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:48,799
understand

1979
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:51,599
what is happening under the hood so the

1980
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:52,160
way we

1981
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,680
worked with this was actually we wanted

1982
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,599
to do a classification

1983
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:58,400
which was to sort of determine what

1984
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,280
cells

1985
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,599
are ultimately the ones that die with

1986
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:04,079
drug which is the sensitive cell

1987
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:06,079
versus the cells that don't die of drug

1988
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:07,280
those are the resistant

1989
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,520
cells so if you have this data where

1990
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,039
you've treated them with drug and some

1991
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:12,559
of the cells are alive and some of the

1992
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:14,240
cells are dead after drug treatment

1993
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:18,158
so again um resistant versus sensitive

1994
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:20,799
we wanted to use a classification model

1995
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:22,839
to figure out well what are these

1996
01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:25,439
features that lead to cells that tend to

1997
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:27,040
be alive or tend to be dead

1998
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:30,399
at the last time point and so we were

1999
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:32,560
interested in basically identifying

2000
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,839
the most strong features that lead to

2001
01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:38,399
cells being classified as sensitive

2002
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:41,198
versus resistant

2003
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:42,479
so if you're not familiar with how

2004
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:45,439
random force models work um

2005
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,439
you don't get one single tree so i've

2006
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:49,040
drawn a single tree here for the

2007
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,479
classification where it's like oh

2008
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:52,960
depending on the levels of this protein

2009
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,560
you would go into this bucket versus

2010
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,000
this bucket when you're dealing with a

2011
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
random forest it's a forest so there's

2012
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,520
too many of those trees you don't have

2013
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:02,719
one single tree or one consensus tree

2014
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:06,238
but you do get a sense of what tends

2015
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:09,520
to be an effective split um

2016
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,799
i wrote gate here because that's the

2017
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:12,880
word we use a lot in biology is the

2018
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,719
gating based on expression like high

2019
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:16,399
expression versus low expression of a

2020
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:17,198
protein

2021
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:18,640
but you can think of it as like the

2022
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:21,120
split in each level of the tree

2023
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,759
so something that tends to pop up a lot

2024
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:24,960
like let's say

2025
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,520
marker x does a really good job of

2026
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:29,120
splitting between cells that are

2027
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,319
resistant versus cells that are

2028
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:31,279
sensitive

2029
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:33,198
um in a random force model you can see

2030
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:34,640
what tends to be a good

2031
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:37,920
splitter and those become like

2032
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,479
more important variables so they're

2033
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,399
weighted more highly

2034
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:43,439
and so even though you don't get a

2035
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:46,000
single tree you do get that information

2036
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,679
and so we got that information and what

2037
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:50,719
we saw was that there were clearly

2038
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,799
a most important marker for

2039
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:54,480
distinguishing cells that live in cells

2040
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,440
that die

2041
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,199
and it actually tended to be pretty

2042
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:59,040
similar between these two drugs that

2043
01:09:59,040 --> 01:09:59,360
work

2044
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,840
in wildly different ways like the

2045
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,520
biology of what these two drugs are

2046
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:05,440
doing is incredibly different

2047
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,600
and yet the same two features were the

2048
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,480
most powerful for making the cells

2049
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,400
more likely to be resistant or more

2050
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,239
likely to be sensitive to both of these

2051
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:15,679
drugs

2052
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:17,840
and so again if you're thinking about

2053
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,400
the goal of this project is to identify

2054
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,159
what makes a cell more likely to be

2055
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:24,960
resistant and ultimately the practical

2056
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,800
application of that is if you know what

2057
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,400
makes that cell

2058
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,080
special from the get-go like if you know

2059
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,400
oh ultimately this patient will probably

2060
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,159
relapse because there are these cells

2061
01:10:34,159 --> 01:10:36,080
that have a lot of these proteins and

2062
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,760
that for some reason makes them more

2063
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,840
hardy like more resistant

2064
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,400
if you know that ahead of time your goal

2065
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,480
would be oh can we like preempt that

2066
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:45,280
somehow right

2067
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,120
if we can kind of cut them off at the

2068
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:48,880
pass we know that those cells will

2069
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,239
ultimately probably

2070
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:52,880
not respond to the drug can we add

2071
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,719
something additional so they

2072
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:57,840
they they'll kind of like we hit most of

2073
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,120
them with the first drug

2074
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,880
but the second drug kind of hits the

2075
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,560
ones who would have responded

2076
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,920
or would have failed to respond the

2077
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,080
first time we still eliminate them with

2078
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,440
the second

2079
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:10,000
like line of attack um and so that's

2080
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,159
what we've decided to pursue which was

2081
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:15,360
that we had a specific therapy against

2082
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,840
mcl1 which is one of these two top

2083
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,280
features

2084
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,360
and so what we did is we showed that if

2085
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,640
you co-treat

2086
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:26,719
with a therapy against mcl1 so that's

2087
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:28,320
what's actually shown here on the far

2088
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:31,360
right if you co-treat with them they're

2089
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:32,000
very

2090
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,480
synergistic and i want to be clear to

2091
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,560
define what synergistic means for

2092
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:39,120
cancer biology what synergistic means

2093
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,040
for cancer biology is that

2094
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,679
the effects of the drugs are not

2095
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:44,640
additive

2096
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:47,199
so if one drug kills 10 and another drug

2097
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,320
kills 30

2098
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:49,600
it's not like you just add those

2099
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:52,960
percentages together it's actually that

2100
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,640
you kill more than you would have

2101
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,560
expected than if you just added the two

2102
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:59,199
together that's when it's synergistic

2103
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:02,159
and what we found was that using this

2104
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:04,080
inhibitor against mcl1 which was that

2105
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,400
highly predictive feature

2106
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,800
using that in concert with the original

2107
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:09,679
drug was

2108
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:11,520
very synergistic it was like we killed

2109
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,800
the original cells with

2110
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,280
dexamethasone and we killed some cells

2111
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,640
that would have been left over with the

2112
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,480
mcl1 inhibitor but we also just

2113
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,040
generally

2114
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:20,960
killed more than just the two of them

2115
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,600
added together

2116
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,360
i just wanted to say that these other

2117
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,199
two were just other examples of

2118
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:28,719
treatments that are kind of similar to

2119
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:30,640
mcl one and they kind of help but they

2120
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:32,320
don't help to the same extent

2121
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:34,560
as mcl one because that was what we

2122
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,080
identified as the

2123
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:40,239
key feature of our resistance cells

2124
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:42,080
and i just want to share we did find

2125
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,760
that that ultimately was true of

2126
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,000
patients as well is that patients just

2127
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:46,960
did better

2128
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:50,080
with the two treatments as opposed to

2129
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,760
with any treatment alone like we had

2130
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,000
more killing of cancer cells

2131
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,320
but i do want to really highlight again

2132
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,480
and this is a continuous problem

2133
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,880
this middle bar here these middle

2134
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:03,120
samples these dots are showing for each

2135
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,520
patient how many cancer cells did we

2136
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,760
kill with the combined treatment

2137
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,920
and you can see that each point tends to

2138
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:10,800
be lower

2139
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,760
than either treatment alone so these are

2140
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:16,080
just one treatment at a time

2141
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:17,679
and you can see for example this purple

2142
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:19,120
dot we

2143
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:21,199
it actually this this treatment actually

2144
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:23,280
led to more cells being alive which was

2145
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,080
interesting

2146
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,800
uh versus this treatment killed some

2147
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,159
some of the cells

2148
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:30,400
with the two together we tended to kill

2149
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,600
more cells

2150
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,920
but it also tended to be more than just

2151
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:34,880
the addition

2152
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,080
it would kill like multiplicatively

2153
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,159
um but i do want to point out that most

2154
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:42,239
of these don't actually go to zero

2155
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:43,280
and i think that's a very important

2156
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,520
thing to highlight is that we again kill

2157
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:48,320
more cancer cells but we don't usually

2158
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:48,800
kill

2159
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,400
all of the cancer cells and that's where

2160
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,040
we draw the line between being curative

2161
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:55,960
versus just helping prolong life

2162
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:58,480
[Music]

2163
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:00,239
all right i think realistically that's

2164
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:01,520
all i had time

2165
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,360
to talk about i thought i had less to

2166
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,040
talk about but i didn't

2167
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,040
um so i think i wanted to just put this

2168
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,280
slide up and just like open it up for

2169
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:12,719
questions broader questions um i just

2170
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:14,480
wanted to put this here that if you're

2171
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,719
interested in careers that relate to

2172
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:20,000
cancer biology and ai applications

2173
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,719
there are a lot of options um so i just

2174
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:24,800
put a couple of different

2175
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:27,120
companies or non-profit institutes that

2176
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,440
i know have actively recruited a lot of

2177
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,440
computational biologists recently

2178
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:33,280
or computational folks who work on

2179
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,040
biology problems

2180
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,120
there's a lot of issues around again

2181
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,080
trying to

2182
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,320
you know create the best algorithm to

2183
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,080
know how to stratify

2184
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,719
patients or just be able to dive into

2185
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:45,440
the data and

2186
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:48,080
better understand how cancer functions

2187
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,400
or a specific type of cancer functions

2188
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,239
all of those are really active areas of

2189
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:54,320
research and of course

2190
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:57,280
in current usa i know that kovid is

2191
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:58,320
dominating

2192
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:01,440
health interests right now but i will

2193
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,440
say that's kind of anomalous like for so

2194
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,679
long america has been sort of this first

2195
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:07,280
world country where we don't

2196
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:09,280
think a lot about infectious disease

2197
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:11,280
with like a couple of exceptions

2198
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,280
cancer has by and large been like the

2199
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:14,640
thing that dominates

2200
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,800
the american consciousness in terms of

2201
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:17,840
health and that's

2202
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:19,360
we've just kind of been in a weird time

2203
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,120
where that's actually not true

2204
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,040
but that's been true for like decades

2205
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,960
like i think the war on cancer started

2206
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,560
in like 1950

2207
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,800
and we've been fighting it ever since to

2208
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:29,920
try to understand

2209
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,400
how to cure cancer so i think this is a

2210
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,480
very active area if you're interested in

2211
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:35,920
it um

2212
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,600
it really draws on a lot of different

2213
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,360
understandings of modeling and

2214
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,040
the different types of data you'll work

2215
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:42,480
with

2216
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,159
yeah definitely this is a very critical

2217
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:46,560
area so so one quick question i have is

2218
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:49,120
one of my colleagues jeff huber started

2219
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:50,840
a company called grail

2220
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:53,920
g-r-a-i-l the the mission was to detect

2221
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:54,480
cancer

2222
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:57,280
early so do you know anything about the

2223
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:57,840
work

2224
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:01,280
at grey grail um i'm not familiar with

2225
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:02,080
it

2226
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:05,440
i'm just like looking it up so yeah to

2227
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:06,960
be able to detect early

2228
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:10,320
uh seems to be very useful right

2229
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:13,440
like in my age i will be very happy to

2230
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,520
be able to do some kind of early

2231
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,800
detection yeah yeah that's a great point

2232
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,640
um i didn't even bring it up

2233
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:23,199
but there's an entire world of cancer

2234
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:24,080
screening

2235
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,480
which we consider different like cancer

2236
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,480
diagnosis versus cancer screening cancer

2237
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,719
diagnosis is where you have a reason to

2238
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:32,480
suspect there's cancer right like you're

2239
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:33,360
like oh

2240
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,120
you have symptoms like you're coming

2241
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:36,960
into the office the doctor's office for

2242
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,000
a reason

2243
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,080
and so the issue of diagnosis is like

2244
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:41,280
yeah you don't want to

2245
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,360
misdiagnose you don't want to you want

2246
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:45,199
to understand what's happening as best

2247
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:47,280
as you can that involves staging or like

2248
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,800
how aggressive their cancer is or if

2249
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,400
it's a certain subtype

2250
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:53,199
so that's diagnosis screening is where

2251
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:55,120
you find cancer where you have no reason

2252
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:55,920
to suspect

2253
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,920
the person has cancer and so that

2254
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,360
actually usually tends to be

2255
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,520
imaging related things so like for for

2256
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:02,880
for women it's like

2257
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:06,120
mammograms for general population like

2258
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:07,840
colonoscopies like

2259
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,760
there's lots of ways we try to screen

2260
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:11,199
for cancer ahead of time but a lot of

2261
01:17:11,199 --> 01:17:11,520
them

2262
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:15,040
are intense like resource intensive

2263
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,120
and a lot of them are imaging based so i

2264
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,320
do know i'm just looking at

2265
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,080
grail it's like there is a lot of

2266
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:22,640
interest to see if you could

2267
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:25,679
detect the hints of cancer from a blood

2268
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:26,560
sample like

2269
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,480
taking blood and testing blood is like

2270
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,480
one of the most like common workflows in

2271
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,360
healthcare

2272
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,880
so if you could just like take blood and

2273
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:33,920
you're like yeah i'm going to test your

2274
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,760
cholesterol but i'm also going to like

2275
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,679
see if you have cancer like that would

2276
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:39,840
be very easy to integrate into

2277
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:40,640
healthcare

2278
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:43,840
pipeline like it wouldn't be as onerous

2279
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:44,320
as

2280
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:45,920
currently we just have to bring people

2281
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,760
in and do a colonoscopy which takes a

2282
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:48,320
lot

2283
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:51,280
of resources um yeah so i know there is

2284
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:53,199
a lot of interest there i think a lot of

2285
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:54,159
times though what i

2286
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:58,400
imagine for those types of um problems

2287
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,320
in trying to solve those problems is

2288
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:01,920
it's partially a hardware issue like

2289
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:02,960
it's harshly like

2290
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:05,679
do we have technology that's sensitive

2291
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:07,280
enough to be able to pick up on the

2292
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,239
signal

2293
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:09,920
and then on the software side it's like

2294
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:12,080
okay if we have this really dim

2295
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,960
signal and it's a mishmash of like it's

2296
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:17,120
very noisy can we still

2297
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:19,280
tell that it's something significant so

2298
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,199
i think that's still just an active area

2299
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:22,480
both on the

2300
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,560
engineering side and also on the data

2301
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:28,159
side okay thank you

2302
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,080
are there any other questions i can

2303
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:32,400
answer

2304
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,560
do blood tests currently screen for

2305
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:37,920
blood cancer um

2306
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,400
i don't know how routine it is it is

2307
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,120
something that

2308
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:44,239
tends to be very obvious um

2309
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:46,640
if someone has a blood-based cancer if

2310
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,080
you take a blood test

2311
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:51,440
um it both can affect

2312
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:54,480
the way your blood behaves so for

2313
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,840
example the way that you

2314
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:58,400
you form like clots like if you bleed

2315
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:58,880
like

2316
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:00,880
the ability of the blood to clot the way

2317
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,080
that we'd expect it to

2318
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:04,480
is changed so a nurse might be like wow

2319
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:05,440
this blood is not

2320
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,360
like this blood is behaving kind of

2321
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:09,679
abnormally um but also if they do any

2322
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:11,600
kind of test that involves a smear where

2323
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:12,880
they just like

2324
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,640
splay out the blood and they look under

2325
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,719
a microscope if you have a blood cancer

2326
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:17,840
they would be able to see that right

2327
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,440
away i just don't know that every single

2328
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:20,840
type of test

2329
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,120
involves looking under the microscope

2330
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,400
but those tend to be really

2331
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:27,679
um obvious yeah

2332
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:29,840
blood cancers though tend to be very

2333
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:30,880
like they tend to

2334
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,640
manifest quickly and have symptoms

2335
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:37,840
quickly um

2336
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:43,440
yeah i think health and physical

2337
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,880
examinations i think that's really

2338
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,960
interesting because again

2339
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,679
things like colonoscopies or prostate

2340
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:50,640
exams can

2341
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:53,120
help with early detection but like it's

2342
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:53,679
a very

2343
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:55,679
private experience and so a lot of

2344
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:57,360
people just don't want to get

2345
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:58,880
screened like they're like oh i don't

2346
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:01,040
want cancer but i also

2347
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:03,040
either like it's a lot of resources you

2348
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:04,480
need good health care access but a lot

2349
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:05,360
of people also just

2350
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,920
don't want to go get the screenings done

2351
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,360
because they're very invasive

2352
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:12,320
or if they feel personally invasive so

2353
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:13,280
that's also an

2354
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,719
issue as well so like something like a

2355
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:16,320
blood test i think is very normal to

2356
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:17,920
people and i think they would be more

2357
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,880
willing to

2358
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:22,320
to be part of that procedure

2359
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:25,760
um yeah i don't know if there's ways to

2360
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:26,159
detect

2361
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:28,080
other types of cancer from blood imaging

2362
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:29,760
um technically if you have a

2363
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:34,080
late stage um one way that cancer

2364
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:36,239
might be spreading from one place to

2365
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:38,400
another is through the blood

2366
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,440
but it's very rare um i mean it's very

2367
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:42,400
rare to see

2368
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:44,239
right like so if you have a cancer

2369
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:45,760
that's started in one organ and it's

2370
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,440
metastasizing to another organ and the

2371
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:48,719
way it's doing so is by

2372
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:51,600
transit through the blood so technically

2373
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,120
in your blood somewhere there might be

2374
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:54,960
transiting cancer cells

2375
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,159
i just think that the chances that

2376
01:20:56,159 --> 01:20:58,320
you'll like extract some blood look

2377
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,320
under a microscope and see that cancer

2378
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:01,199
cell is still

2379
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:03,440
fairly rare like there's so many blood

2380
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:04,320
cells

2381
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,480
like they're you've kind of drowned out

2382
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,080
any of these rare

2383
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:09,760
spreading cancer cells but yes

2384
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:10,880
technically there are these things

2385
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:11,280
called

2386
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,440
circulating tumor cells so the common

2387
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,840
name is ctcs

2388
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:17,199
and there's been interest in either

2389
01:21:17,199 --> 01:21:18,880
finding them but again they're very rare

2390
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,159
so it's hard for researchers to

2391
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:22,080
specifically get them even if they're

2392
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,480
trying to pick them up um and so that's

2393
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,159
not even to diagnose like you you

2394
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:27,360
already know the person has cancer

2395
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,480
you're just trying to catch them

2396
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,000
that's very challenging but i think

2397
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,840
there is interest again it kind of hints

2398
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:33,120
at this company grail

2399
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:36,239
is that um when you have ctcs like these

2400
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:38,480
circulating tumor cells in the blood

2401
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,880
they very often break like they very

2402
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,560
often will just die in transit because

2403
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,800
they're undergoing so much like

2404
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,719
pressure like the blood that flows

2405
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:48,560
through fast at such high pressure

2406
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:51,360
that cells often will break apart um if

2407
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,080
they're not

2408
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,679
blood cells blood cells are designed to

2409
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:55,600
do it but you know a cell in your from

2410
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:57,520
your lungs isn't designed to

2411
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:59,600
to withstand that type of pressure and

2412
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,520
so those cells will break open

2413
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,600
and their dna and their contents will

2414
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,760
then be flying around in your blood

2415
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,760
and so a company like grail is trying to

2416
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,199
find the fragments

2417
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:12,239
of a cancer cell in your blood

2418
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:14,000
um that's a little more likely that you

2419
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,679
might like pick up on hey there's some

2420
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:16,639
rogue dna

2421
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:19,120
in this blood sample like that that is

2422
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:20,400
something you might be looking for

2423
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:20,880
instead

2424
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:23,600
rather than imaging and seeing a cancer

2425
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,840
cell

2426
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,199
uh what am i most excited about um

2427
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:32,880
i do think immunotherapy is very

2428
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:35,040
exciting as i said i mean my

2429
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,040
my my thesis work was on targeted

2430
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,400
therapies but it was kind of

2431
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,400
disheartening because like

2432
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,880
the evolution paradigm is so powerful

2433
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:45,199
right like the diversity of life we see

2434
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:47,840
on this planet is because of evolution

2435
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,199
and the fact that

2436
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:51,440
you can see such clever evolution like

2437
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,120
it's supposed to be a completely random

2438
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:55,040
process and yet you see

2439
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:56,960
living things adapting to the most

2440
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:59,120
ridiculous circumstances on this earth

2441
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:01,679
like evolves to eat this one thing and

2442
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:03,520
live in this one place and adapt this

2443
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:03,840
one

2444
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,960
crazy weather pattern and so

2445
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:08,960
knowing that that's the power of

2446
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,880
evolution and that cancer cells are

2447
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:11,920
really

2448
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:14,639
in tune with that power um is a little

2449
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:16,080
disheartening when you work on targeted

2450
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:17,840
therapy because you're kind of

2451
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:20,560
very outpaced in terms of what you do

2452
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,000
versus immunotherapy

2453
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,120
is using your cells to fight these

2454
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:26,400
cancer cells like your cells

2455
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,600
unfortunately have kind of been

2456
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:28,480
suppressed

2457
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:30,719
during cancer like for some reason the

2458
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:31,840
cancer has

2459
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,159
evaded your immune system but if you

2460
01:23:34,159 --> 01:23:36,239
could empower your immune system immune

2461
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:38,239
systems are a little more

2462
01:23:38,239 --> 01:23:40,159
flexible or adaptable than like a

2463
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:41,600
chemical compound

2464
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,440
and so i think that's exciting if we can

2465
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:45,440
somehow empower our own immune system

2466
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:47,280
because our own immune system

2467
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:49,360
is flexible it's not just sort of do we

2468
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,440
see compound or not does compound bind

2469
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:52,560
to target or not

2470
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,040
there's like more to it yeah so i think

2471
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:58,239
that's what i'm most excited about

2472
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:03,840
yeah any other questions

2473
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:11,280
okay so if you have more questions to

2474
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:13,360
