1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,240
hi good morning welcome back to cs372

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,800
today we start the last segment of the

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,840
course

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,559
and we plan to cover consciousness for

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,880
the next six lectures

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,960
then why do we get into consciousness

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,960
because several scholars agree the

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,720
current ai is again some limitations

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,080
and the major reason is because the

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,840
current eye only models human

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,279
unconsciousness so we have to be able to

12
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,600
understand consciousness thoroughly

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,239
and then we perhaps can model

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,680
consciousness

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,320
and try to study consciousness involving

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,920
multiple disciplines

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,719
including psychiatry biology

18
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,719
neuroscience physics and so on so forth

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,120
and today we start our first lecture and

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,160
doctor vladistud rajdu duvari

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,440
will present the topic of ai in

22
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,199
psychiatry

23
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,160
and dr duvari enjoys distinguished

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,680
academia records including his bs degree

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,640
in biology and chemistry from caltech

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,960
and phd in psychiatry from stanford

27
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,840
university and finally md from uc san

28
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,960
diego

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,840
without further ado let's welcome dr

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,400
duvari

31
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:24,880
so

32
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,520
in the initial seg in a

33
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,400
title you've seen this phrase brainless

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,000
and mindless and i just wanted to give a

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,079
little bit of an introduction to that

36
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,280
um

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,600
this is a quote from a new york times

38
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,759
magazine article

39
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,680
where one psychiatrist is quoting

40
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,680
another psychiatrist

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,280
and the psychiatrist being quoted as

42
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,720
leon eisenberg so that's what the

43
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,240
support refers to

44
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,640
so the quote is that in the first half

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,119
of the 20th century american psychiatry

46
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,600
is virtually quote unquote brainless

47
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,079
and the second heart half of the 20th

48
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,920
century psychiatry became virtually

49
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,200
mindless

50
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,719
so

51
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,000
hence

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,960
my

53
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,040
hope is that

54
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,520
with advances and maybe particularly

55
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,639
technology

56
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,440
uh we're able to go past both

57
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,560
mindless

58
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,800
and brainless specifically the reason

59
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,400
these terms were used here is because

60
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,760
historically

61
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,120
uh psychiatry had a lot of

62
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,040
reliance on psychoanalysis some of the

63
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,840
earlier ways of treating patients and so

64
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,120
that's what is being referred to by

65
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,440
leon eisenberg as brainless and then

66
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,959
mindless refers to this

67
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,440
shift to using medication to treat to

68
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,920
the exclusion of everything else

69
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,000
and the point he's really making is that

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,680
it really should be a combination i mean

71
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,800
at the end of the day it should be a

72
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,840
holistic approach

73
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,120
um so

74
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,120
taking a step back before we kind of get

75
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,280
into what we want to do i like this

76
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,080
quote because ultimately um we should

77
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,159
know what we're solving for so this is a

78
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,800
quote from steve jobs

79
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,560
so if you define the problem correctly

80
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,599
you almost always have the solution

81
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,280
so what is the problem so hopefully the

82
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,040
next few slides will start to define

83
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,040
that so um

84
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,680
to begin with um if you look at the

85
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,120
overall burden

86
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,640
in terms of

87
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,280
diseases and their impact

88
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,400
you'll find that about fifth down is

89
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,159
mental health and substance use

90
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,280
disorders

91
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,239
so pretty large impact

92
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,680
so

93
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,319
really making the point that

94
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,120
not is it only suffering although that

95
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,360
should be plenty of a reason

96
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,120
there's also

97
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,450
an equivalent of a

98
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,640
[Music]

99
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,599
lifetime impact and impact in terms of

100
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,319
disability and other measures will show

101
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,360
you money as well

102
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,400
when it comes to money this is a

103
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,239
an older quote this is from about you

104
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,439
know seven ish years ago um seven eight

105
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,640
years ago so 186 billion was spent on

106
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,319
healthcare services to treat mental

107
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,400
health disorders um and we're talking

108
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,280
about the us so

109
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,439
44.7 million or 18 almost 20 percent of

110
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,759
u.s adults 18 or older reported any kind

111
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,560
of mental illness and that's in 2016.

112
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,880
and then again close to about 10 of

113
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,960
adults um

114
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,479
visited a provider in in the prior year

115
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,960
in 2015 again speaking to impact

116
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,759
why is all of that important well one

117
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,320
important reason is

118
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,080
suicides

119
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,280
one of the unfortunate consequences of

120
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,600
problems with mental health and

121
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,840
particularly that there's a worrisome

122
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,400
trend in suicides

123
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,280
now if you look at

124
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,639
the graph here

125
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,360
the solid line uh

126
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,600
hopefully you see my pointer

127
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,840
is the average so that's the average

128
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,400
across the us and it's average over time

129
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,160
going up so

130
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,280
there up to about 2015 in this graph

131
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,800
and

132
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,039
the interesting thing that this shows is

133
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,720
that if you look at the top half of the

134
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,320
graph

135
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,720
and you would ask okay let's divide it

136
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,280
between rural and not rural and there

137
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,400
are details about what that is uh which

138
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,759
one do you think would have a higher

139
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,759
rate um you know in the past there have

140
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,360
been all these um

141
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,440
um ideas about how

142
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,919
more urban aspects have a negative

143
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,280
impact on um well-being of people

144
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,560
and so

145
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,560
what this in fact shows you is that the

146
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,720
top half of the graph is all

147
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,639
less than urban so

148
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,080
small metro micropolitan so-called

149
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,360
and then presumably rural non-metro

150
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,400
all of those are higher and one

151
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,960
source as to why

152
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,800
could be this graph

153
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,360
this this depiction so on the left side

154
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,280
you have the suicide rates that we were

155
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,600
talking about except in this case the

156
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
color codes for

157
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,560
the number per 100 000

158
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,880
um over a similar period that we talked

159
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,759
about

160
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,240
and across the country so deeper blue is

161
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,440
a problem

162
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,479
and then now if you overlay that

163
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,160
you'll see

164
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,440
at least one thing but maybe two one is

165
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,400
that it also starts to correlate with

166
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,880
a deeper color on the right graph and

167
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,479
the deeper color on the right graph

168
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,720
speaks to

169
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,240
basically a negative

170
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,000
sort of availability as in a deficit of

171
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,639
psychiatrist relative to what we'd like

172
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,520
so the the white colored boxes are

173
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,960
presumably kind of the middle of the

174
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,919
road

175
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,000
and um

176
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,479
things going down deeper in this color

177
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,440
scheme towards the reddish pinkish

178
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,319
um our deficit so the deficit starts to

179
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,800
overlap with where the problems are and

180
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,120
so maybe that's telling us something

181
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,720
the other thing is that we're also

182
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,360
looking at rural areas

183
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,880
much like what we saw in the graph

184
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,280
before

185
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,199
so

186
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,440
if you're not enough providers maybe

187
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,440
that's part of the problem

188
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,160
now and and where they are in terms of

189
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,280
networks

190
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,360
of resources

191
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,880
this graph tells you a little more as

192
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,400
you try to understand the problem and

193
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,160
say okay well who's at high risk who's

194
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,800
not this is males and females

195
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,440
and so male patients as you can tell the

196
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,360
numbers are higher on the right side

197
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,960
just to give you

198
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,960
a trend here

199
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,080
and also across age groups so higher

200
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,919
across the board

201
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,160
so potentially something

202
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,639
biological potentially something also

203
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,319
social in terms of roles involved

204
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,280
now if we look at continue to look at

205
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,720
the impact

206
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,479
of mental health

207
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,080
in in our social context and how that's

208
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,120
evolved

209
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,280
very recent

210
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,840
trend has been that the pandemic really

211
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,400
changed how virtual care is viewed

212
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,520
and so one might think okay well um

213
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,039
virtual care means you can reach people

214
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,520
you don't have to be bound by physically

215
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,240
geographically where you are that should

216
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,599
be a good thing

217
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,120
um and well

218
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,120
that's potential has certainly been seen

219
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,519
there's lots of money that's been raised

220
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,958
um starting in 2019 um and that

221
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,200
continued through 2020 2021

222
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,440
and

223
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,959
you know we'll see how that continues

224
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,240
into the future but with all this

225
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,800
money being poured in and opportunity

226
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,680
for seeing therapists

227
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,360
what's also been noticed is that there's

228
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,839
been a big uptick 30 percent increase in

229
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,800
the um

230
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,240
sorry 60 increase in users

231
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,040
uh

232
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,880
in this one particular instance of an

233
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,800
app called talkspace which again makes

234
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,640
access very easy

235
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,000
and

236
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,080
the 60 of his users are in therapy for

237
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,640
the first time so again speaking to this

238
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,680
idea that maybe maybe with virtual care

239
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,720
becoming

240
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,040
more widespread

241
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,200
and more

242
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,480
easily

243
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,920
accessible

244
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,640
across the u.s despite all those graphs

245
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,000
and

246
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
pictures i showed you maybe that will

247
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,839
have an

248
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,200
impact um

249
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,519
so as we're defining the problem um and

250
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,120
we kind of this is much more current

251
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,360
as of this month

252
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,760
one of the companies that was part of

253
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,120
this group of many companies that

254
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,279
were heavily invested in to provide

255
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,680
mental health services

256
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,519
had a bit of a setback

257
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,399
where

258
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,080
there was a lot of concern about how

259
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,399
prescribing was happening and in this

260
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,200
instance

261
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,920
the headline is referring to how

262
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,600
adderall which was being prescribed

263
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,240
was now being halted

264
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,800
and there's a lot more news about this

265
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,279
so again kind of maybe following the

266
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,680
pendulum maybe it got too easy whatever

267
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,360
that means

268
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,240
one

269
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,240
thing to note in this context especially

270
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,120
with

271
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,519
adderall which is a control substance

272
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,680
is that

273
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,360
it was not something you could do

274
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,720
earlier you you you you couldn't

275
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,040
um prescribe adderall

276
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,600
uh essentially over the internet um

277
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,320
before we were in this emergency

278
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,440
authorization period which we're in now

279
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,480
so one of the questions is

280
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,320
by making virtual care easier to get to

281
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,720
by removing barriers

282
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,360
are we only doing good or are we also

283
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,720
doing some harm

284
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,680
um

285
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,160
and and why is that harm happening if

286
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,680
it's happening what is a better way to

287
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,600
do it so again starting to define the

288
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,160
problem um what

289
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,839
is access the issue and uh with access

290
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,519
uh starting to be addressed is that

291
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,839
gonna be enough

292
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:18,640
so

293
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,800
we've talked about kind of the the needs

294
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,600
side of the equation um

295
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,600
you know it's i think important to start

296
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
to understand a little bit about what we

297
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,519
talk about when we talk about depression

298
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,120
or anxiety or some of these other

299
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,160
disorders

300
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,200
and so we'll go through a few snapshots

301
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,320
of these disorders so depression of

302
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,360
course

303
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,959
specifically major depression which is a

304
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,959
clinical diagnosis one of the most

305
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,839
common mental disorders in the u.s

306
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,399
and it can really impair your ability to

307
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,160
function in life

308
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,079
and obviously have very serious outcomes

309
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,399
um bad ones like we just

310
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,399
looked at in the graph

311
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,040
there's a manual that um

312
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,480
basically provides the diagnostic

313
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,320
criteria in psychiatry and that's called

314
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,399
a dsm-5 so that's what you're seeing

315
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,560
abbreviated here and so this is one

316
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,639
example of a summary of what

317
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,880
clinical depression or major depressive

318
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,040
disorder looks like so period of at

319
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,200
least two weeks

320
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,200
where a person experiences

321
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,639
loss of interest

322
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,120
low mood

323
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,200
and a few other symptoms that go along

324
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,880
for the ride

325
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,800
and if you look at the next slide

326
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,399
and we're only talking about depression

327
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,160
here

328
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,120
in a recent survey this is from 2017

329
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,839
from one of the federal

330
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,160
agencies what you see is that

331
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,279
if you were to use this whole

332
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,720
donut here to represent

333
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,519
folks coming in or needing depression

334
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,720
care

335
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,920
you find that about one third 35 percent

336
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,760
have no care when it comes to adults

337
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,240
this is adults on the left side

338
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,760
and then on the right side

339
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,880
60 double that so almost two-thirds of

340
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,800
adolescence no treatment at all

341
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,279
and then you have pieces of the other

342
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,839
aspects so on the left side the adults

343
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,320
have a combination of seeing

344
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,959
mental health professional and

345
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,880
having access to medication

346
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,600
some do medication only on the left side

347
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,120
and then similarly

348
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,560
there are smaller proportions of

349
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,720
medication only

350
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,560
on the right side

351
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,639
and male health proportion mental health

352
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,480
professional visits

353
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,920
along with medication now the

354
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,680
significance

355
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,160
of the dark blue is that um

356
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,160
for really most of the conditions that

357
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,480
are studied in mental health treatment

358
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,040
um it's important that

359
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,519
the treatment involve both a way to

360
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,600
think about your endless how to cope

361
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,839
with your illness learn skills

362
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,959
to manage your symptoms to escalate when

363
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,440
needed in addition to taking medication

364
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,600
so it's really that combination that is

365
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,519
seen to be the best option and yet the

366
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,240
the data here tells you that um there

367
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,160
are a lot of people who are outside the

368
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,079
quote-unquote best option

369
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,079
among both adults and adolescents so

370
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,320
again further defining the problem

371
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,519
now

372
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,000
that little quote up there uh with the

373
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,720
dsm-5 might have given you the idea that

374
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,519
you know

375
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,600
depression is one thing

376
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,680
well turns out depression is not one

377
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,880
thing

378
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,000
depression is uh many things and what i

379
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,040
mean by that is there are many versions

380
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,360
so uh this is just to give you an

381
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,720
example not to go really into uh depth

382
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,800
on any of these topics

383
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,519
but

384
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,920
an example of one variety of depression

385
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,839
here if you see my pointer is psychotic

386
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,079
depression so this is where depressions

387
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,440
get so bad

388
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,639
that um it starts to create a break from

389
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,800
reality so where the person cannot

390
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,440
separate reality from the um

391
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,120
delusional

392
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,800
aspects of their thinking that are

393
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,720
starting to emerge

394
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,320
and that influences their behavior

395
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
influences their thoughts of course

396
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,279
um

397
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,800
and then we talked about major

398
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,199
depressive disorder uh postpartum is

399
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,519
another case you often hear about it

400
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,079
when there are bad outcomes here um you

401
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,680
know it could be somebody who's given

402
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,240
birth and something bad happens to the

403
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,959
to the baby because um

404
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,760
basically uh the the mother who's

405
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,240
delivered has severe depression

406
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,680
and if untreated unrecognized unmanaged

407
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,320
that can have pretty bad effects um

408
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,720
for the mom as well as for the baby

409
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,800
uh and in some cases it can result in

410
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,000
the death of the child so um

411
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,079
in in that case uh death of the neonates

412
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,120
a newborn

413
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,040
baby

414
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,079
and then there's other patterns um one

415
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,399
sort of different direction is that so

416
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,560
far when we talk about depression most

417
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,480
people refer to one direction of

418
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,480
dysfunction meaning that your mood goes

419
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,000
down

420
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,519
if there's a baseline it drops

421
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,600
and it drops persistently bipolar is an

422
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,959
example where

423
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,199
it can go both ways so you can have an

424
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,519
unreasonable

425
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,199
amount of

426
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,519
excitement joy

427
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,160
and essentially what ends up becoming a

428
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,240
really big problem in terms of risk

429
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,920
assessment

430
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,199
because

431
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,920
your extreme sort of

432
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,480
so-called mania can impair your

433
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,120
cognitive decision making so as you can

434
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,279
tell just like having a low mood and

435
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,199
seeing everything to a dark lens can

436
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,440
obviously have a negative impact on your

437
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,639
life

438
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,560
so can an unreasonably positive uh

439
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,160
switch of that and there are some other

440
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,759
characteristics as well so again

441
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,519
starting to give you a sense of there

442
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,360
are different kinds of things out there

443
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,279
when we talk about depression different

444
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,800
flavors

445
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,720
each with their own course

446
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,959
and so when we start to think about what

447
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,399
is the problem we're treating what are

448
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,480
the consequences of this problem we also

449
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,880
need to recognize that uh we're gonna

450
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,480
have to somehow

451
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,280
uh deal with this issue that there are

452
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,240
um

453
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,880
uh other variables than basically saying

454
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,799
it's is it depression or is it not

455
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,720
depression

456
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,079
well dr duvaris can i uh ask a question

457
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,439
so this month is is called uh mental

458
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,160
health awareness month right in may

459
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,360
and i i saw some statistics seems to

460
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,960
show uh

461
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,039
about 2020 end of 2020 or in the 22 2019

462
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,880
the percentage of

463
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,120
u.s adults suffering from depression is

464
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,080
about

465
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,480
19.8

466
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,039
so that's much higher than your

467
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,640
yeah or 10

468
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,600
and because of pandemic and

469
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,760
the ratio further increases

470
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,960
so so this is really a major crisis and

471
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,840
for

472
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,280
teenagers

473
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,559
folks in high school and maybe college

474
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,720
because of academia

475
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,080
pressure

476
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,880
job pressure and many other pressures

477
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,640
and it seems like the ratio is even

478
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,760
higher

479
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,679
yes yes no i think the pandemics really

480
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,640
had a pretty bad impact um when it comes

481
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,760
to

482
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,360
mental health in general

483
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,559
uh and then various you know problems

484
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,039
within depression being one of them

485
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,280
um yeah so i think as

486
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,360
to your point as bad as some of these

487
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,600
problems are that we're looking at here

488
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,000
and as bad as the numbers look like

489
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,280
they're actually underestimating uh

490
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,360
the current situation and that's

491
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,559
unfortunate uh because uh it's not like

492
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,120
uh you you needed more emphasis it was

493
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,760
already pretty bad so yeah i agree

494
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,760
um and i think i touched on it a little

495
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,640
bit at some point um but um

496
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,280
the the impact of kovid

497
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,440
has definitely been

498
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,960
multifaceted

499
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,679
to some degree it's just the impact of

500
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,080
having a pandemic take over your life

501
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,880
on the other side it's also limitation

502
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,320
of resources

503
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,400
which now are starting to open up and

504
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,360
and maybe even pretty good in some areas

505
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,600
but um that was a big issue during the

506
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,039
pandemic certainly in the middle of it

507
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,440
so now you've got this problem of

508
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,600
there's more problems and there's fewer

509
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,440
ways to address them so of course you

510
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,840
know the outcomes are going to be bad

511
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,000
um

512
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,679
does that does that address the question

513
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,400
oh yes yes yeah the motivation of me

514
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,960
asking this question is i think the

515
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,280
severity of the problem is even worse

516
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,840
than you just presented yes that's true

517
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,320
and also the severity of the the

518
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,799
depression itself means the condition of

519
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,039
depression because of my my family

520
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,480
routinely

521
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,320
we have this kind of weekend gathering

522
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,919
with our friends

523
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,000
and two three years ago

524
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,799
virtually all the kids are very healthy

525
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,160
and uh

526
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,960
i mean very sadly in recent days and

527
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,600
they are one-third of kids suffer from

528
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,400
major

529
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,640
psychological disorders

530
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,440
and they cannot go to school they are

531
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,640
one person

532
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,200
even in a coma state

533
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,880
so so it's not really just getting

534
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,120
depression but the severity

535
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,799
right of the symptom

536
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,720
it's just horrible and it's one

537
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,440
one out of three means even your family

538
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,760
is okay but your surroundings your

539
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,679
neighbors i mean you can encounter

540
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,039
people having

541
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,799
these kind of problems and most of the

542
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,880
adults or parents they don't really

543
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,360
understand depression very well right so

544
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,679
in the beginning may be mistreated uh

545
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,159
consider depression symptoms as

546
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,280
something like

547
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,080
uh

548
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,400
moral problems right like

549
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,880
eating disorder often uh parents will

550
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,880
say well this is a bad choice you're a

551
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,000
bad joke

552
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,320
but in fact it's not a matter of choice

553
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,640
it's a matter of uh

554
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,760
psychiatric disorder yeah yeah no you're

555
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,760
right you're right and actually i've

556
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,440
those are some great points i was

557
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,000
actually going to say that actually um

558
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,640
eating disorders is one of these aspects

559
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,480
that really has shot through the roof

560
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,919
during this period

561
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,960
um and and exactly to your point um

562
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,159
it's all

563
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,720
it's it's such a common thing in terms

564
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,280
of having a cultural and social context

565
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,520
for eating that people feel like well

566
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,679
you know i think i can feel like an

567
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,280
expert on this

568
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,159
as a parent or as a family member and

569
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,480
um i'm not going to think twice about

570
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,320
what i'm saying or doing about it

571
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,159
because you know it's eating

572
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,760
what what's what's there to think about

573
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,200
so deeply

574
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,799
but unfortunately

575
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,960
that can lead to trouble and and i yeah

576
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,799
i see this all the time i mean literally

577
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:47,919
last week

578
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,640
um a parent basically said exactly that

579
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,960
uh where you know oh we thought this kid

580
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,880
and this was a very young kid

581
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,600
um you know was being picky kind of

582
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,960
picking and choosing and otherwise doing

583
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,480
you know her thing

584
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,919
we didn't think it was a big deal and

585
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,760
then the next thing we know the heart

586
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,640
rate drops and uh the kid's in trouble

587
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,159
has to be in the hospital so it's a

588
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,960
complete shock for the parents um

589
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,559
even though as you say you know there's

590
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,760
all these articles there's all this

591
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,320
information out there but i think um you

592
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,840
know what you're also highlighting this

593
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,480
is separate really from at least

594
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,080
uh some of the

595
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,039
technology initiatives there's a big

596
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,039
challenge in terms of translating what's

597
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,120
out there in terms of information to

598
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,320
something you can use personally

599
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,960
because what you can use personally uh

600
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,320
seems to somehow fall under the radar uh

601
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,240
and and it's hard to kind of separate

602
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,919
your own experience from sort of

603
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,039
quote-unquote knowledge that um you know

604
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,559
people have access to so i think i think

605
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,200
it's a great point uh and maybe in the

606
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,000
conversation ahead uh we'll be able to

607
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,120
um

608
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,440
pick up on that and see maybe maybe

609
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,600
there is a role for technology there

610
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,720
um

611
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,080
okay thank you

612
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,760
yeah of course um

613
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,679
uh great points so

614
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,520
um we were talking about depression

615
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,520
until now this is anxiety again giving

616
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,320
you snapshots of some common disorders

617
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,200
um

618
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,559
so when we talk about an anxiety

619
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,400
disorder as opposed to hey i'm anxious

620
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,559
about this or that uh

621
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,120
this is anxiety that doesn't go away it

622
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,799
gets worse over time

623
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,280
and it interferes with your ability to

624
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,000
do your job go to school

625
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,440
function in society really

626
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,320
and so similar to depression i want to

627
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,840
give you a taste that again there are

628
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,039
different types

629
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,400
um

630
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,840
many people have heard about having a

631
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,880
panic attack so panic disorder uh which

632
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,400
is where people have these frequent

633
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,760
panic attacks

634
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,520
um is

635
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,240
anxiety that's kind of concentrated in a

636
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,480
short amount of time which looks quite

637
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,320
different compared to generalized

638
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,720
anxiety disorder which is what people

639
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,960
call quote unquote worry words right you

640
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,360
worry all the time about everything you

641
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,120
wake up in the morning you just worry i

642
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,440
mean everything is just a worry um and

643
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,240
then again that's different compared to

644
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,320
phobias which are hey i'm afraid of

645
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,640
spiders it's not just afraid of spiders

646
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,080
it's very good fighters to the point

647
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,799
where it's actually you know influencing

648
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,919
how you manage your day-to-day um and

649
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,799
causes some pretty extreme reactions um

650
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,200
and in many cases it may be things that

651
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,240
other people

652
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,200
don't find an issue at all

653
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,919
so again giving you a sense that um yes

654
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,919
you know we start to get a sense of

655
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,279
some of these problems like depression

656
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,440
anxiety but also start to understand

657
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,240
that

658
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,400
um there's gonna be types of those that

659
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,240
need to be factored in when you design

660
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,640
solutions

661
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,400
substance use disorders is another

662
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,159
category

663
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:50,960
and

664
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,400
it can either

665
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,960
come by itself or together with one of

666
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,480
the others

667
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,919
so this

668
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,279
little

669
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,240
graphic shows you that

670
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,679
it's a big problem

671
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,200
over 7 million as of this count

672
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,640
this is again from one of the federal

673
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,840
agencies

674
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,279
[Music]

675
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,960
as we were talking about it can come by

676
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,279
itself or separately so on the left side

677
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,279
you see about 40 percent

678
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,440
um

679
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,039
also have other mental health diagnoses

680
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,880
so that's two out of five

681
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,520
and then

682
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,799
you look at it the other way now you

683
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,240
look at somebody with

684
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,080
things that are not a substance use

685
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,400
disorder so some other mental health

686
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,039
diagnosis about one out of five of those

687
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,880
has a substance use disorder so again

688
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,120
pretty pretty significant overlap given

689
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,480
the size of these numbers

690
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,320
and then

691
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,679
back to what we were talking about with

692
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,360
depression we had that big problem in

693
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,279
terms of people not being in treatment

694
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,840
and so here among adults this gives you

695
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,679
a flavor because if you're trying to

696
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:00,880
solve this problem you want to get a

697
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,039
sense of okay well why aren't people

698
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,880
accessing the solutions

699
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,919
um

700
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,520
about 40

701
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,039
the top one here

702
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,960
not ready not ready to stop using

703
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,000
whatever the substance is

704
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,720
35

705
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,640
have no health insurance and could not

706
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,919
afford the cost

707
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,320
so maybe this is pointing to this fact

708
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,120
that in this subpopulation versus maybe

709
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,480
others

710
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,640
there's a concentration of people who

711
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,360
are not able to afford treatment

712
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,600
so again when you have solutions you

713
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,720
want to be able to address the

714
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,880
demographic you're trying to solve it in

715
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,640
and maybe your solution is great if

716
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,120
you've got all kinds of resources but is

717
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,279
basically useless if you were in this

718
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,200
bucket of 35

719
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,000
um

720
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,799
of the people surveyed here

721
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,559
um and then there's other things you

722
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,159
know like it says might cause neighbors

723
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,640
to have negative opinions so

724
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,159
typically that's under the bucket of

725
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,840
quote-unquote stigma

726
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,559
um and people worry is this gonna affect

727
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,600
my job or you know if i use my insurance

728
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,640
is it gonna

729
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,640
you know are people gonna find out

730
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,760
um who has access to that um what do i

731
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,440
do you know that i see the

732
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,200
underparamount where you know it's not

733
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,960
clear where where do you actually get

734
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,720
people uh what's the first step um

735
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,120
so uh start again starting to get you a

736
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,279
sense of what are the problem points

737
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,880
um

738
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,480
and then um this is an example where um

739
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,760
just like we talked about earlier

740
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,520
there's that percentage of people who

741
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,240
either have the substitutes alone or

742
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,159
have it together with a mental health

743
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,399
disorder that is not substance use

744
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,720
and so in that so-called co-occurring

745
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,399
subset um off the people who did not get

746
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,880
access to care what were their reasons

747
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,559
so this is the combo this is not just

748
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,399
substance uses combo of substance use

749
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,279
and another mental health disorder

750
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,760
top reason can't afford the cost uh it's

751
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,279
a big problem like we were talking about

752
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,279
so when you start designing solutions

753
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,880
that's that's a big consideration

754
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,480
because

755
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,720
now you got to think about okay is my

756
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,960
solution actually going to be useful you

757
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,720
know i think it's great and i think it

758
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,120
works great but maybe it only works

759
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,679
great if you have the resources

760
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,120
um

761
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,640
and then there are other aspects that

762
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,480
have to do with perception fear of being

763
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,760
committed oh what are they going to do

764
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,919
once they find out that i need help

765
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,159
uh am i going to be locked up i might

766
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:31,919
you know what's going to happen next i i

767
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,360
won't have any control over what happens

768
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,720
to my life and this maybe even if

769
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,240
they already don't have much control

770
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,480
over their lives because of the uh

771
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,240
illness that they're dealing with

772
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,200
um and then futility of treatment uh you

773
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,880
know which again raises questions about

774
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,240
why that is

775
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,120
um

776
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,240
and then we talked about some of the

777
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,559
others

778
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,600
so

779
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,480
as we're trying to summarize the problem

780
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,640
you know again you you saw the trends as

781
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,120
i as i mentioned them earlier

782
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,240
um

783
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,279
it's it's it's quite a familiar list

784
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,039
probably for many of you

785
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,640
um because

786
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,240
more and more has been written about

787
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,720
this now during the pandemic especially

788
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,240
but um one thing i would recommend um

789
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,919
and this is um

790
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,159
somebody um

791
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,240
that's really taken a a deep look at

792
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,039
this

793
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,440
it's tom insult who used to be the

794
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,880
director of the national institute of

795
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,559
mental health

796
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,039
and more recently has worked with

797
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,399
california

798
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,480
at the state level and and in other

799
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,720
capacities

800
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,039
he decided um

801
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,039
in this book that just came out to go

802
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,000
around and interview people across the

803
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,320
mental health system in different forms

804
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,480
of the mental health system

805
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,080
pretending basically to be a journalist

806
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,080
not that he said he was then most people

807
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,159
know who he is in the field

808
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,399
uh but to take that role and to say okay

809
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,720
let's ask questions about from a patient

810
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,640
journey perspective

811
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,679
uh what's working what's not working

812
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,000
and when something's not working uh why

813
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,360
is it not working

814
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,679
um and so this is one review there have

815
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,520
been plenty of other reviews for this

816
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,039
book that just came out

817
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,399
um so

818
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,399
what it does is it gives the reason i

819
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,240
mention it here um

820
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,080
is that um it gives a bit of flavor to

821
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,039
some of these uh bullet points so we

822
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,960
know there's a problem with access we

823
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,039
saw that even in this talk from the

824
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,960
beginning with the with the graphs and

825
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,640
the maps of the us

826
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,520
but

827
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,679
what is the problem with access so one

828
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,200
of the points that the book makes is

829
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,120
well actually if you look at the ratio

830
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,039
of how many therapists are available

831
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,039
it's a pretty decent number there are a

832
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,799
lot of therapists in the us

833
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,559
okay well then how is there an access

834
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,600
problem and what he points to is that

835
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,600
there's a problem in terms of how

836
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,480
therapy is delivered are the

837
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,000
evidence-based

838
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,080
tools being implemented are the

839
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,760
resources that

840
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,799
we know

841
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:03,600
work

842
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,080
being implemented in a in a regular

843
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,120
uniform effective way and so that's one

844
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,760
problem right is that the

845
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,440
access may be there to a person who can

846
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,679
help you see you but it's not done in an

847
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,080
evidence-based way

848
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,240
they're system hurdles which

849
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,880
you'll see all over the book basically

850
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,399
whether it's you want to get into a

851
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,360
program get into a hospital

852
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,360
get a certain kind of medication that is

853
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,960
recommended for you

854
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,039
there's hurdle after hurdle after hurdle

855
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,320
that

856
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,320
requires you to be quite dogged

857
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,640
persistent and in many ways

858
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,480
even super functional

859
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,960
and all this from somebody where you

860
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,640
know it's a brain disorder that's

861
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,240
actually impairing them so how does that

862
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,720
work how are you supposed to be able to

863
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,799
overcome those hurdles to actually get

864
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,320
access

865
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,919
and a related issue is treatment

866
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,240
decisions so meaning that again if a

867
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,240
disorder is impacting you and say it's a

868
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,960
psychotic disorder like schizophrenia

869
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,600
it changes how you perceive reality you

870
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,760
had a real problem because

871
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,919
now that person has to decide for

872
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,000
themselves that oh you know never mind

873
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,480
what my voices are telling me i have to

874
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,559
go get them

875
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,440
and the laws and you know a lot of the

876
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,320
states

877
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,159
fit that they fit this idea that you

878
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,360
know people should be making their own

879
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,960
decisions they should be doing what's

880
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,480
good for them

881
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,919
some places um the mental health and

882
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,440
clinical systems can can uh

883
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,840
take take control of the treatment

884
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,960
process

885
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,600
for various periods of time uh in other

886
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,000
places not so much so there's not a

887
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,240
uniformity there

888
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,399
california is a good example there's not

889
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,360
a uniformity across the 50 plus counties

890
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,440
in california so the mental health

891
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,120
treatment you get especially for a

892
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,679
severe mental illness like schizophrenia

893
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,480
can really be 50 plus versions within

894
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,679
one state

895
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:00,559
so

896
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,240
that's obviously not conducive to

897
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,840
anything positive in terms of good

898
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,279
outcomes

899
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,080
and then the other point he makes

900
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,600
is

901
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,440
we talk about stigma a lot that's

902
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,640
definitely

903
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,799
gets a lot of air time in in the public

904
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:15,840
sphere

905
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,440
but what he actually starts to make the

906
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,320
point of is that it you know stigma may

907
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,480
be underselling it it's really

908
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,399
discrimination it's just you have to

909
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:25,919
come out and say it it's discrimination

910
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,200
if somebody's got a mental health

911
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,000
diagnosis it's flat out a problem

912
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,760
uh and unless you're in some very secure

913
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,880
position

914
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,440
status or something else

915
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,679
people are just not willing to risk that

916
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,679
and so that can lead to all the problems

917
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,320
you saw earlier as to why people don't

918
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,159
seek treatment or sometimes when they do

919
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,679
see treatment like when you go to an

920
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,279
emergency room

921
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,720
the way you're treated is quite

922
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,679
different

923
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,799
to if you came in with a heart attack uh

924
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,039
in many ways some of these psychiatric

925
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,360
emergencies are like a quote-unquote

926
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,360
brain attack well why is that different

927
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,440
why should that be treated differently

928
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,240
uh

929
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,440
the fact is

930
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,039
uh these conditions are treated

931
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,239
differently

932
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,639
um and then as you're sort of starting

933
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,480
to get the picture here a lot of the

934
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,760
hurdles here require social support so

935
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,760
whatever form that takes it could be

936
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,000
your family it could be a broader group

937
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,119
like you heard um

938
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,199
from

939
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,359
from professor chang here and so

940
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,879
it's

941
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:29,520
it

942
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,440
it could be

943
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,159
um it could be mitigated by social

944
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,000
support but what should that social

945
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,359
support look like

946
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,399
um and uh do people know that they need

947
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,399
to implement that put that into action

948
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,560
one of the issues is

949
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,399
confidentiality

950
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,280
at least in the context of mental health

951
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,679
extends to family

952
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,440
so what that means is

953
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,480
um

954
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,800
there are lots of situations where you

955
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,400
could have

956
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,119
a young adult in a hospital or an adult

957
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,400
uh older

958
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,839
older person

959
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,720
and if that person for whatever reason

960
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,480
decides i don't want anybody else to

961
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,359
know maybe it's because of how

962
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,680
the mental disorder is impacting them

963
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,320
and they can't think through that

964
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,760
where they feel bad because they're

965
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,359
super depressed and they don't really

966
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:22,480
want to talk to anyone whatever the case

967
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,839
all of those

968
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,040
factors

969
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,960
end up having this negative impact that

970
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,640
if they say no i don't i don't want

971
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,040
anybody else to know um

972
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,720
even if they're worrying out there not

973
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,960
knowing what happened to you know their

974
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,560
family their loved one

975
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,720
that's okay that's that's how the

976
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,640
current law is written

977
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,240
um so

978
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,640
so yes we talk about social support but

979
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,040
in fact this the way the system is set

980
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,000
up

981
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,520
uh is terrible to actually facilitate or

982
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,839
even allow it

983
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,000
and then um this is something that's

984
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,359
touched on here but is probably

985
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,960
addressed

986
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,720
even better or elsewhere which is

987
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,160
diagnoses we refer to in dsm 5 that i

988
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,079
alluded to

989
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,760
the diagnosis in psychiatry they're

990
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,079
really syndromes they're a collection of

991
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,839
symptoms that we put together that hang

992
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,960
together and as they come together

993
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,599
and present as one thing or so one

994
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,680
combination of things

995
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,520
it's easy to forget that they're

996
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,520
actually a collection of things

997
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,200
uh it's not it's not one thing as in oh

998
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,240
you know

999
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,400
um there's this deficiency of this

1000
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,320
protein or

1001
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,040
a signaling molecule like insulin and

1002
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,560
then therefore you get the downstream

1003
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,280
effect it's it's it's many things coming

1004
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,200
together to create the scenario that we

1005
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:45,920
see

1006
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,640
so

1007
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,240
um a lot more needs to be done obviously

1008
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,560
to understand that aspect and and

1009
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,640
there have been a lot of advances one

1010
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,000
book i think

1011
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,400
you'll probably get some

1012
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,960
exposure to here

1013
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,960
is a book called projections which was

1014
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,960
written by a

1015
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,240
neuroscientist psychiatrist

1016
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,839
friend of mine from back in training

1017
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:10,000
who's who's on the faculty at stanford

1018
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,640
uh and he he really wrote this amazing

1019
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,560
book um

1020
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,320
and i say amazing not just because of

1021
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,079
the science it's a very beautifully

1022
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,920
written book uh

1023
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,420
in terms of the writing style um and so

1024
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,880
[Music]

1025
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,440
so in that particular book

1026
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,000
written by carl diceratzo carl really

1027
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,240
talks about

1028
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,200
how you can start to conceptualize

1029
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,480
to some extent

1030
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,000
the presentation of the mental health

1031
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,800
disorders but also the science behind it

1032
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,400
you know how do you tease it apart how

1033
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,079
do you start to understand

1034
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,880
uh the neurons the neuronal circuits

1035
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,119
that may be driving um some of those

1036
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,800
aspects and and what does the future

1037
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,079
look like

1038
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,599
so again lots of

1039
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,359
interesting stuff there but that that's

1040
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:56,320
probably

1041
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,240
the last part uh with diagnosis and

1042
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,400
syndromes is probably best served um

1043
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,040
through a through a different source

1044
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,760
yes yes dr dr duvari i i actually just

1045
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,160
finished reading the book projections

1046
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,720
oh great it's a remarkable remarkably

1047
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,079
written book

1048
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,040
uh

1049
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,520
for the the troubles or the problems or

1050
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,680
challenges you just mentioned right i i

1051
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,400
think uh i i talk to many

1052
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,440
young kids the first one is uh

1053
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,400
often people do not want to reveal they

1054
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,000
have problems or they don't seem to have

1055
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,920
problems right especially like eating

1056
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,240
disorder if you send a kid to the

1057
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,640
hospital they are going to be evasive

1058
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,320
they are not going to say yes i have

1059
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,800
eating disorder right so it's really

1060
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,040
hard to detect and number two is that

1061
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,480
you mention

1062
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,720
reputation you don't want people to know

1063
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,599
and

1064
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,760
the law actually saying if you are above

1065
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,359
18

1066
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:50,960
your parents cannot make a choice for

1067
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,040
you so we do see parents they want to

1068
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,040
really want to they are totally stressed

1069
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,560
out they want to see when they are kids

1070
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,560
so in institutions

1071
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,720
but their kids refused to go to

1072
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,400
institutions though so they kind of

1073
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,560
stuck in the middle right but finally

1074
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,800
come back to carl's

1075
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,079
book

1076
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,359
i think the amazing thing is this uh

1077
00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:13,760
optogenetic right optogenitic technique

1078
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,920
and because so far for mental disorders

1079
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,400
we can only see kind of symptoms we

1080
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,800
cannot use instruments to detect

1081
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,400
different from other diseases like you

1082
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,520
can do blood work you can do x-ray but

1083
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,240
for mental disorders there's no

1084
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,680
scientific tools you can say oh your

1085
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,920
serotonin is too low or your dopamine

1086
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,400
dopamine whatever level is too low so

1087
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,000
therefore you have this and that or it's

1088
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,800
really subjective sometimes yeah so so

1089
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,440
i'm really excited about this

1090
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,960
technology of

1091
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,760
opto genetics hopefully eventually will

1092
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,560
be

1093
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,079
uh in this treatment process

1094
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,079
yeah training process and even at this

1095
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,240
point you know as we understand more

1096
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,160
about how some of the symptoms come

1097
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,760
about uh to your point um because the

1098
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,560
symptoms seem so commonplace

1099
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,480
um you know yeah i have days where i'm

1100
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,319
depressed or i'm anxious or something

1101
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:11,119
else

1102
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,079
um

1103
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,800
or tired um well

1104
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,319
what what's to say

1105
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,000
i'm not trying hard enough i mean you

1106
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,599
alluded to some of this before you know

1107
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,920
it becomes sort of the social construct

1108
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,720
so

1109
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,760
um

1110
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,480
once we start to understand that

1111
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,000
at the level of what's happening in the

1112
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,920
brain

1113
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,839
as optogenetics is certainly one

1114
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,480
powerful way to do

1115
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,680
my hope is that that can help drive

1116
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,359
people starting to feel like you know

1117
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,119
what i'm not making this up when

1118
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,440
somebody says i should just deal with it

1119
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,200
uh that's not okay

1120
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,240
uh you know i know that's not okay but

1121
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,079
now this gives me something to hang on

1122
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,760
to to say okay i i can i can grab this

1123
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,200
this fact here

1124
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,280
uh that has been established somehow and

1125
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,800
that gives me the confidence and

1126
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,720
validates my experience

1127
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,520
uh which is i think a major problem in a

1128
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,400
lot of what we see in mental health um

1129
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,400
and and maybe that'll also drive some of

1130
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,920
the solutions you're talking about such

1131
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,200
as maybe

1132
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,400
um

1133
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,480
allow better communication between

1134
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,240
parents and kids and you know provide

1135
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,720
kind of that context as opposed to sort

1136
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,040
of everything getting more

1137
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,480
hidden because of stigma and shame

1138
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,720
at least in that context so

1139
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,680
kind of

1140
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,400
you know in sync with that um the whole

1141
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,440
the hope is that apps maybe can help

1142
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,920
technology can help you know ai can help

1143
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,960
and um some people simplistically say

1144
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,400
well you know when we do some

1145
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,400
comparisons people are more willing to

1146
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,440
share on uh technology platforms than

1147
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,880
they are in person to person um

1148
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,720
again these are you know

1149
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,119
small assessments small studies maybe

1150
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,720
even anecdotes

1151
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,040
but time will tell

1152
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,800
the other big thing is of course

1153
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,119
accessibility so

1154
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,240
as opposed to having to make

1155
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,079
appointments etc there is a way to

1156
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,920
collect information that is time and

1157
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,480
location agnostic potentially can be

1158
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,720
highly personalized we're certainly able

1159
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,040
to do that in the commercial world where

1160
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,119
things are getting super personalized to

1161
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,200
be able to sell you things well maybe we

1162
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,480
can use some of that technology to

1163
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,480
actually do some good

1164
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,079
in this sort of way

1165
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,000
and then improve engagement you know

1166
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,680
people are not coming to treatment

1167
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,720
they're not doing the things that are

1168
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,800
good for them well how can we drive that

1169
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,880
how can we use again the same kind of

1170
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,440
tools that are being used to get people

1171
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,359
to keep using apps or selling them

1172
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,599
things to actually apply it in the

1173
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,599
mental health sphere

1174
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,880
and then there's a few other things

1175
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,400
which i think time will tell whether we

1176
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,560
are able to do you know better diagnosis

1177
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,400
are there ways to use

1178
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,359
big data and different ways of

1179
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,200
using sensors different ways of

1180
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,400
combining sensors and data

1181
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,119
that is patient provided to drive

1182
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,359
analytics to do decision support that's

1183
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:00,319
better

1184
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,720
um you know time will help

1185
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,000
and then we'll touch on some of these

1186
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,240
and what what the problems are uh along

1187
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,040
the way

1188
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,880
um and then we talked about treatment

1189
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,319
you know maybe there ought to be some

1190
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,079
standardization that can be driven by

1191
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:13,200
technology

1192
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,359
uh maybe part of that is delivered by

1193
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,240
the technology maybe part of that is uh

1194
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,160
directed by it so maybe not delivered

1195
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,640
but at least you start to push the idea

1196
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,960
that hey you know this this really

1197
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,000
should make you consider treatment x it

1198
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,119
shouldn't

1199
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,079
be

1200
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,560
what the person you happen to contact is

1201
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,079
good at it should be the thing you

1202
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,000
actually need for the condition that

1203
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,440
you're presenting with

1204
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,280
um and then as you talked about

1205
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,359
optogenetics and other things uh maybe

1206
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,839
that can be factored in as time goes on

1207
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:44,960
um

1208
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,480
i just want to do a quick time check so

1209
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,280
how much time do we have um through the

1210
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,839
rest of the lecture here about 30

1211
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,720
minutes okay great so that will give me

1212
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,839
plenty of time

1213
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:56,960
um

1214
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:57,290
so

1215
00:43:57,290 --> 00:43:58,560
[Music]

1216
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,240
the next few slides are just to give you

1217
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,040
a sense that um people have been looking

1218
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,880
at trying to apply technology this was

1219
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,920
one review and basically their idea is

1220
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,000
you know anytime and everywhere

1221
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,440
ubiquitous tech right that's what

1222
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,880
they're looking at

1223
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,119
to add to traditional care

1224
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,280
and that's this laundry list here

1225
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,880
non-clinical focus on the bottom

1226
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,800
clinical focus on the top

1227
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,599
tailored to specific diagnoses so in

1228
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,280
this survey there's a fair number um

1229
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,400
30 plus up here and about 10 plus down

1230
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,839
here

1231
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:35,040
and the pattern that emerges is that

1232
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,599
a lot of them focus on sensing right

1233
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,280
that's that's where the technology is

1234
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,760
it's both passive and active sensing and

1235
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,000
i just want to spend a few minutes on um

1236
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,319
passive versus active so the main

1237
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:49,280
takeaway is that because in a lot of

1238
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,599
these situations where somebody going

1239
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:52,960
through especially a mental health

1240
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,160
crisis

1241
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,760
may not be the perfect person to

1242
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,520
actually use an active

1243
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,119
sensing strategy

1244
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,680
it would be great if technology can

1245
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,839
create ways of doing

1246
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:06,400
effective passive sensing so something

1247
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,400
that technology is tracking over time an

1248
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,800
app kind of tracks xyz

1249
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,839
maybe 10 variables 100 variables

1250
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:14,800
more

1251
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,599
and sets off an alarm and that says okay

1252
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:19,520
this this is something's going wrong

1253
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,839
here and let's try to use predictive

1254
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:24,160
analytics so that um as you see up here

1255
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,720
30 good predictive modeling uh use

1256
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,800
predictive analytics so that you can use

1257
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,560
that sensor data that's grabbed

1258
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,760
passively to then hopefully prevent

1259
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,400
a bad outcome that would be

1260
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,839
really one of the great ways that

1261
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:42,000
technology can help with the treatment

1262
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,599
of mental health conditions and so

1263
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,280
but in order to get there obviously

1264
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,800
there's a lot of obstacles and we'll

1265
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,040
kind of talk about where things are in

1266
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,040
the meantime but as you can see we're

1267
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,359
really at the first step here where we

1268
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:58,240
are most of our effort in the field at

1269
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:03,200
least as of this point pre-2020 is uh in

1270
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,160
sensing um

1271
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,040
this is another review that kind of

1272
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,560
looked at it over a couple of years to

1273
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,160
see okay you know now we're getting this

1274
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,160
proliferation of apps in the last few

1275
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,800
years this particular one was published

1276
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,680
let me see i think 2019 2020

1277
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,200
uh 2019

1278
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,240
um

1279
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,680
you know what do we look at and so they

1280
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,839
looked at you know what kind of platform

1281
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:28,640
they looked at are there any claims

1282
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,160
being made about hey this is going to

1283
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,960
treat xyz condition does it cost you

1284
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,960
anything what kind of intervention is

1285
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,240
being used

1286
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,200
um

1287
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,720
and then

1288
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,160
you know what are the mechanisms you

1289
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,640
know is it is it tracking where you are

1290
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,880
is it asking you questions

1291
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,640
is it looking at what you're doing with

1292
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,640
your phones and asking you to write

1293
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,440
notes or is there gamification

1294
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,680
as some examples

1295
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,839
and so

1296
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:58,160
basically in this particular comparison

1297
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,240
where they looked at

1298
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,040
a group of apps they looked at 10

1299
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,839
android and 10 ios by these six

1300
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,720
categories so 120 total

1301
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,920
so some as you can tell like

1302
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,599
hypertension are not mental health uh uh

1303
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,040
the others are

1304
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,480
um

1305
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,800
and they basically say okay um so in

1306
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,280
brackets it's what happened in 2018

1307
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,599
outside brackets what happened in 2019

1308
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,240
so the hope is well apps are increasing

1309
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,520
in number

1310
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,400
uh

1311
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,760
you know as of now there's thousands um

1312
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,000
so are they getting better if we use

1313
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,119
these metrics you know do users like it

1314
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,200
is their privacy policy now whether it's

1315
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,240
good or not

1316
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,839
just is there one do they tell you

1317
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:44,160
what's happening uh is there a way for

1318
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,920
you to get rid of your data

1319
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,319
uh if you don't want it to be there uh

1320
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,000
is it gonna cost you something

1321
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,040
um

1322
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,000
and uh how often is it being updated is

1323
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,839
it telling you something about is it

1324
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,480
gonna treat condition xyz

1325
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,599
um

1326
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,079
and is there evidence so say they tell

1327
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,920
you okay we're gonna do this that and

1328
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,520
the other thing but is there actually

1329
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,359
evidence in some kind of a way or

1330
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:09,520
they've studied or somebody has studied

1331
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,319
to actually provide some support to that

1332
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:13,920
and that that's probably the worst of

1333
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,400
this table where you can see it's in you

1334
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,400
know it used to be zero in many

1335
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,839
instances

1336
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:21,839
went up to tens and 20s but it's still

1337
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,760
very low in terms of the percentage of

1338
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,839
apps that are providing any sort of

1339
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:28,400
support to say we're gonna do x and this

1340
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,319
is the reason why you should believe

1341
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:31,119
that

1342
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,200
so that's a big problem so it's sort of

1343
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,400
like you know

1344
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,240
being provided medication and saying

1345
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,920
well you know i think this will be good

1346
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,440
for you well what's the evidence for

1347
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,359
that well never mind about that

1348
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:43,359
um or you know one out of five or one

1349
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:44,480
out of ten

1350
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,480
times that happens you actually have

1351
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,480
some basis to say that so that's where

1352
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,480
we are in this space

1353
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,720
so it's it's unfortunate the numbers in

1354
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,640
terms of what's available definitely

1355
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,680
increasing

1356
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:00,079
uh but it seems like the quality is not

1357
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,240
so how do you navigate this um one of

1358
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:06,720
the ways um to navigate this is um there

1359
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,559
thankfully there are a few sort of

1360
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,800
categorizing websites

1361
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,599
uh that do a bit of reviewing and also a

1362
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:16,720
bit of basically feature categorization

1363
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,440
and so this gives you um an index of

1364
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,440
done on the left side here and then

1365
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,119
these are just some examples various

1366
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,280
apps and this column

1367
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,960
you know is it well written

1368
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,040
there's a patient facing etc so this is

1369
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,800
done by mind hosted on one of the

1370
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,720
harvard hospital sites

1371
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,599
um led by a team up there that does

1372
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,160
digital psychiatry and so they have a

1373
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,319
group of raters that goes through and

1374
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:42,319
systematically does

1375
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:43,440
basically what they describe on their

1376
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,720
website you know this is how we're

1377
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,640
rating them so when you go in and you

1378
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,319
want to look for something

1379
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,079
we can tell you what we think of it in

1380
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,480
this somewhat detailed way so then you

1381
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,240
can go filter and the hope is that

1382
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,599
ultimately it will help you with app

1383
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:58,599
selection

1384
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,599
um these are some examples of what that

1385
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,520
looks like right so accessibility how

1386
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,920
much does it cost um

1387
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,160
does it need to be online

1388
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:12,400
uh privacy policy as you saw um you know

1389
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,800
what features does it have um how do you

1390
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,800
get people to engage with the app and

1391
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,400
then as we talked about clinical which

1392
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,359
is an important category

1393
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:23,200
there's also another site that's called

1394
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,520
one mind which tries to do a similar

1395
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,079
thing it's reviewing

1396
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:31,280
aspect seems to be less extensive

1397
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,480
um and so i think in time hopefully um

1398
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,880
it'll be a good complementary resource

1399
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,800
to the um

1400
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,520
first mind site that i uh pointed to

1401
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,359
so

1402
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:48,240
now that we see okay there are apps and

1403
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,839
you've seen some characteristics of what

1404
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:51,839
those apps are what are they trying to

1405
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:53,200
accomplish

1406
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,720
um

1407
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,319
you know technology in the service of

1408
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,160
mental health um

1409
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,640
what is it that they can help with you

1410
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,240
know you've kind of seen that okay there

1411
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,760
are these problems with the apps but if

1412
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,160
you look at the the course of an illness

1413
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,000
in a person

1414
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,520
where can we intervene so this gives you

1415
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,559
maybe a a bit of a flavor of that where

1416
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:15,119
should you intervene so prevention

1417
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,079
um is there a way to give you a risk

1418
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:18,960
score

1419
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,640
that could be one way and especially as

1420
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,720
genomics comes into the picture and we

1421
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,480
maybe learn more from neuroscience so

1422
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,559
maybe there's ways of behaviorally

1423
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:28,079
testing some of that

1424
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:29,119
um

1425
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,520
and so really focusing on wellness uh

1426
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,680
and and measures that are preventive

1427
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,040
because in medicine we tend to do

1428
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,040
prevention the best when we can succeed

1429
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,400
at that

1430
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,559
early detection we talked about sensors

1431
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:41,920
using

1432
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,559
analytics to serve alerts

1433
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,359
maybe also create stress tests so maybe

1434
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:49,119
it's not obvious if you just do passive

1435
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,920
collection maybe there's passive is

1436
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,839
tailored to active where there's a you

1437
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,359
know you play a game and that kind of

1438
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:57,839
tests maybe how you react to things

1439
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:59,119
um

1440
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,200
and then again personalizing that

1441
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,520
in an evidence-based way we talked about

1442
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,280
access in terms of being at the right

1443
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,040
time and the right place maybe even

1444
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,280
being agnostic to

1445
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,520
the current limitations

1446
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,640
we talked about some of these other

1447
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,839
things like decision support

1448
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:18,720
and then also gathering data is is the

1449
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,920
thing you're doing to treat the

1450
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,760
condition is it working

1451
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,119
um

1452
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,599
most people are not out there

1453
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:27,440
putting out data that says hey when i do

1454
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,440
xyz

1455
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,760
this is how well it works and i think

1456
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,200
that should be something that should be

1457
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,119
easy to do so

1458
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:36,720
and i think technology could be a great

1459
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,480
way to get us there

1460
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,880
because then from a consumer end you can

1461
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,480
be a much more informed consumer when

1462
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,640
you say hey i want to do this and i want

1463
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,720
to do it there because look their data

1464
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,280
really speaks um volumes of what they

1465
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,400
can do

1466
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,359
and then we talked about downsides like

1467
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:54,720
alerts for

1468
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,280
adverse events

1469
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,319
so

1470
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:00,480
the other side so those are in the life

1471
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,800
cycle of anxiety depression on the other

1472
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,880
side when we talk about

1473
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,680
um

1474
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,319
what should ai be mindful of as we

1475
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,559
collect all this data as the number of

1476
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,880
apps goes through the roof

1477
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,480
we need proven interventions we've

1478
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,800
talked about that um otherwise what

1479
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,160
you're doing um it's kind of like

1480
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,839
selling snake oil i mean that's that's

1481
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:22,960
not okay

1482
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,200
um the consenting process needs to be

1483
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,040
simple especially for this population

1484
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,960
especially if they're in crisis

1485
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,040
um and for equity you know because you

1486
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,760
don't know if uh everyone in there is

1487
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,200
going to have the resources to kind of

1488
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,800
work through what needs to be worked

1489
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,960
through to understand

1490
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,200
what's the right answer what is what are

1491
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,599
the problems they might run into by

1492
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:45,599
signing on to something like this

1493
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,800
um

1494
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,559
which then speaks to transparency and

1495
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,960
trust supercritical so extra effort has

1496
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,319
to be made especially in this mental

1497
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:53,520
health space

1498
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,760
um the other aspects have to do with

1499
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,920
more practical things um you know

1500
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,280
passive monitoring tends to be more

1501
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,800
practical for the reasons we talked

1502
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,839
about

1503
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:03,520
reduce friction so that people

1504
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,960
incorporate whatever you're doing into

1505
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,880
their workflow

1506
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,400
um and then trying to tailor devices to

1507
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,480
mel health you know right now

1508
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,240
phone is a general purpose thing uh

1509
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,559
maybe it lasts um

1510
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,319
for for longer

1511
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,640
uh but potentially maybe there's even a

1512
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,480
version that um

1513
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,119
that's that's built better uh to cater

1514
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:27,599
to mental health um and then as we

1515
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:28,960
talked about social support is super

1516
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,359
critical so now i want to switch a

1517
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:34,160
little bit to start to say okay you know

1518
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,119
we talked about apps individual

1519
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:39,599
sort of in some detail talked about the

1520
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:41,520
individual course of illness now let's

1521
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,280
take a step back and sort of say what

1522
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,160
are some

1523
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,559
more um

1524
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,720
aiml type strategies that are being used

1525
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,119
this is one

1526
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,760
survey um that i found quite useful and

1527
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,520
let's look at the landscape so big

1528
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,960
picture

1529
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,880
and that will also include systems not

1530
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,520
just individual patient journeys

1531
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,440
um so

1532
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,520
in the application of mlm houses

1533
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,280
specifically looking at ml as opposed to

1534
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,520
just technology in general or apps in

1535
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,480
general

1536
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,119
um as you've seen the

1537
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:16,400
nice little spike here this is 2019 and

1538
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,520
hopefully that continued

1539
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,040
the main

1540
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:24,640
work was in model development um with as

1541
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:27,920
opposed to you know empirical study

1542
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,119
um

1543
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:32,319
applying algorithms or design and

1544
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:33,839
based on what we're talking about and

1545
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:35,920
what we've seen so far i would argue

1546
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,280
it's probably a good time to spend a lot

1547
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,680
more time on design and concept because

1548
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,680
there seem to be some fundamental issues

1549
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,280
with how

1550
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,040
the apps are being designed and fun

1551
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,119
those issues with identifying what is

1552
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:48,640
the problem they're trying to solve you

1553
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:49,760
know what is it that they're solving

1554
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,160
first because if that's not clear then

1555
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,240
you know the solution you have is really

1556
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,440
uh not going to be effective

1557
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,200
this is another way to slice the data in

1558
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,599
terms of what people have been up to um

1559
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:03,920
this is either collecting data

1560
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,920
or it's access to

1561
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,640
existing data and uh where it's coming

1562
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,599
from so

1563
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,760
a big chunk of it is existing data sets

1564
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,119
that's what a lot of the ml work is

1565
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:16,079
being done on health records some part

1566
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:17,839
and some combination

1567
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:20,640
and then as you can tell here sensors as

1568
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,799
we talked about had a good head start

1569
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:25,040
that remains and then the rest of it is

1570
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,240
coming from

1571
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,680
either

1572
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,640
patient

1573
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,480
provided information

1574
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,319
or a large part from social media

1575
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:36,240
and then

1576
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,920
the other question is okay well these

1577
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,640
are the sources and the system setups

1578
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,160
who are the people who's actually

1579
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,760
providing the data

1580
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,440
and as you can see both categories

1581
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,920
whether it's existing data set

1582
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,799
or data collection a significant chunk

1583
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:52,079
is folks without a mental health

1584
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:55,119
diagnosis so here it's a large one which

1585
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:56,720
is troubling because

1586
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,559
really if our goal is we want to collect

1587
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:00,880
data make good models test the models

1588
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,960
and then we'll implement them we should

1589
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:03,920
be

1590
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,480
doing that based on folks with diagnoses

1591
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,040
that we're going to try and treat

1592
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,799
that's not the case at least in the data

1593
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:14,000
collection survey here um it was the

1594
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,920
case more so

1595
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,640
when we're looking at existing data

1596
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,839
that's good but that also has some

1597
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:22,160
pitfalls as we'll see

1598
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,119
so this is a bit of a busy slide

1599
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:26,799
what it's trying to do is give you more

1600
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:29,280
granular information so what is the kind

1601
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,720
of data that's been out there so the

1602
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,559
data collection so people with mental

1603
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:34,400
health conditions small numbers 10

1604
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,200
patients with bipolar 24 with ptsd 25

1605
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,480
with mdd

1606
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,720
and then you know you start to look at

1607
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,920
500 users on twitter

1608
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:48,000
uh 600 participants um

1609
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,760
students are working professional

1610
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,839
almost 2 000 twitter users who

1611
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:53,680
self-report

1612
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,559
various diagnosis 4 000 twitter users

1613
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:57,920
who have some other

1614
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,520
clinical characteristic

1615
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,480
so this is in the bucket of folks where

1616
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,799
there is

1617
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,720
some connection to mental health but

1618
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,599
it's not a diagnosis that you know and

1619
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:12,799
here um it's a verified diagnosis so the

1620
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:15,520
folks in the left column as part of the

1621
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,760
survey of what's going out there going

1622
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,200
on out there in terms of ml studies

1623
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,119
tells you that

1624
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:24,640
the small studies

1625
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,960
have some level of verification in terms

1626
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:27,680
of

1627
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:32,000
mental health diagnoses outcomes even

1628
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,720
the larger groups are for social media

1629
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,640
not been verified

1630
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,480
and a lot of self-report in terms of

1631
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,359
what folks have

1632
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:44,079
and so

1633
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:46,160
and and then on the right side here you

1634
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,440
can also see um

1635
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,640
participants without a clinical

1636
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:51,839
diagnosis

1637
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:54,319
massive data sets so 16 you know almost

1638
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:57,599
17 000 right participants

1639
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:58,720
um

1640
00:58:58,720 --> 00:58:59,520
and

1641
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,480
um

1642
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,480
no use of clinical screening tools so

1643
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,760
these

1644
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,880
massive sets in terms of

1645
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,839
um

1646
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:10,160
the studies being done to build ml

1647
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,799
models and to test ml models are being

1648
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:16,319
done on folks where there is not

1649
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:17,520
a lot of

1650
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,280
clinically informed

1651
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,040
data gathering

1652
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,200
and so if we're going to use this to

1653
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,440
actually design our apps it's going to

1654
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,000
be a problem

1655
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:32,240
this gives you a sense of what we call

1656
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,119
stepped care basically in order to put

1657
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:36,720
some of that

1658
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,000
information that we've been talking

1659
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,359
about

1660
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:43,040
in context so it helps to understand

1661
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,559
when somebody has some level of

1662
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,799
an illness

1663
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:50,079
who sees them

1664
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:51,839
what do they do

1665
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:53,839
and how does that

1666
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:56,880
escalation happen so mild is sort of at

1667
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,240
the bottom this is of course general

1668
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,440
scheme

1669
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:02,720
there are outliers there are maybe even

1670
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,880
non-outliers but different ways of

1671
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,280
navigating the system but this is one

1672
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,559
model

1673
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:09,359
where

1674
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:10,880
you can have this sort of stepwise

1675
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,839
escalation and stepwise increase in the

1676
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:16,240
resource allocated and more specialized

1677
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,079
treatments so inpatient care is at the

1678
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:20,720
top outpatient care primary care

1679
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,280
basically is at the bottom

1680
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,000
ongoing care assessment prevention this

1681
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,400
is a great place for prevention and then

1682
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,599
at the top is

1683
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:31,920
severe life-threatening scenarios

1684
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,200
um

1685
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,200
severity of illness that is hard to

1686
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,200
treat so you have medications etc and

1687
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,200
everything in between so when you start

1688
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,640
to design apps i think one of the

1689
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,400
important things that one has to look at

1690
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,000
is where is it going to fit in this

1691
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,319
continuum what are you targeting and so

1692
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:48,400
far you know there really hasn't been

1693
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,640
much that we can look at and say oh this

1694
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,520
is where this app was designed to help

1695
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,599
it's it hasn't gone to that point at

1696
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:57,359
least any of the surveys that we've

1697
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:59,920
touched on haven't really addressed any

1698
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,920
of that so that's obviously an important

1699
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,640
thing to look at

1700
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:06,480
so this is just summarizing what we

1701
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,119
talked about

1702
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,880
now another survey um that digs a little

1703
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,960
deeper and says okay well we talked

1704
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,680
about how social media is really being

1705
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,880
mined

1706
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,680
uh to try to use um

1707
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:25,839
ml for um for mental health so where is

1708
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:28,319
it coming from and so these are two ways

1709
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:31,040
of slicing that data one is that you can

1710
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,200
see twitter's on top we saw lots of

1711
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,359
studies out there thousands tens of

1712
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,520
thousands of folks who are providing the

1713
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,040
data

1714
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:42,160
that's being scraped from trader um

1715
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,559
and then what is it being studied what

1716
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:46,640
is being used for uh it's been used for

1717
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,960
depression probably predominantly and

1718
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:49,839
then

1719
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:53,839
suicide next and then you see the others

1720
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,799
so again

1721
01:01:56,799 --> 01:01:59,839
the reminder here is that

1722
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:02,319
where would you even apply data that

1723
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:04,400
comes from twitter right maybe primary

1724
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,680
care i don't know

1725
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,760
but maybe that person's in a crisis and

1726
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,599
on twitter so

1727
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,200
unless you ask unless you have some

1728
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,599
context for that um and unless you're

1729
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:16,480
able to understand okay what what is the

1730
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,960
utility of the data i'm collecting

1731
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,640
uh whether it's about depression

1732
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,799
schizophrenia something else suicide as

1733
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:24,079
you saw in there

1734
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:25,359
um

1735
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:27,760
it's it's hard to know what to do with

1736
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,319
it and potentially it's harder to do

1737
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:31,839
anything useful with it in the context

1738
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:32,960
of an app

1739
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,960
so again think about this this sort of

1740
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,000
framework

1741
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,079
um when you're trying to say hey i have

1742
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:40,319
an app that's gonna help with depression

1743
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:42,400
well okay what kind of depression where

1744
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,760
in the spectrum

1745
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,920
can it maybe cross the spectrum does

1746
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,680
your app have the agility that it can

1747
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,280
take somebody who's

1748
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,039
kind of mild right now

1749
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:52,960
uh or maybe only has a family history

1750
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,359
and then maybe it operates at a the

1751
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:57,359
lower end of this or maybe it operates

1752
01:02:57,359 --> 01:02:59,680
at the higher end where it's really for

1753
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:00,880
folks who have

1754
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:03,119
identified problems

1755
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:05,680
and in in other parts of medicine there

1756
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:08,240
are concepts of um you know primary

1757
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,400
prevention secondary prevention etc and

1758
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,720
so you know one can maybe apply that

1759
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,880
kind of framework but so far the apps

1760
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,839
don't seem to do that

1761
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:19,760
um

1762
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,119
so again summarizing the problems with

1763
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:24,720
the efforts out there that are heavily

1764
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,799
driven from data in social media that's

1765
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:29,599
easy to access it appears

1766
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:31,359
but seems to have quite a bit of

1767
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:33,920
problems in terms of uh being either

1768
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,280
valid

1769
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,440
in terms of what the objective is

1770
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,680
lacks a ground truth because

1771
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,599
how do you reference it to something you

1772
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:44,319
know where a data set has folks with

1773
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:45,520
depression

1774
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:46,480
um

1775
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,079
and then um

1776
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:49,839
how about healthy controls how do you

1777
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:51,359
compare that how do you how do you know

1778
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:53,200
that what you're doing is going to react

1779
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,280
differently when somebody doesn't have a

1780
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:58,400
mental health diagnosis

1781
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,760
so

1782
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,160
one way potentially to address that is

1783
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,920
okay let's look at medical records so

1784
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,280
electronic medical records emrs

1785
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,799
maybe they're a good source right

1786
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:09,680
they're

1787
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,440
collecting data as we speak because

1788
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:12,720
whenever you install one of them in a

1789
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,720
hospital all your future patients their

1790
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,559
information is in there

1791
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:18,319
past information's in there for

1792
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:20,160
different lengths of time

1793
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,039
um

1794
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:24,079
so so maybe that's going to help well

1795
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:25,520
okay so

1796
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,000
in in some of the natural language

1797
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,079
processing efforts out there that seems

1798
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:31,440
to be the case people have focused on

1799
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,039
medical records

1800
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:35,920
um to say hey can we get really good at

1801
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,799
using nlp to confirm a diagnosis so i

1802
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:42,079
can look at the words in what i'm seeing

1803
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:44,400
in a note in a chart

1804
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,160
and then i can say oh yeah that's the

1805
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,440
right diagnosis or that's the wrong

1806
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,799
diagnosis hey maybe we should look at

1807
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:49,839
that again

1808
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:52,640
um look at the prognosis and say you

1809
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:53,839
know how well does this person do

1810
01:04:53,839 --> 01:04:55,440
because you have that whole history so

1811
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,680
can you take some of that initial data

1812
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,200
or even decisions

1813
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,520
and then start to do some predictive uh

1814
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:02,880
modeling

1815
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,400
that actually helps clinicians do a

1816
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,000
better job the next time

1817
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
and prompts them saying hey you know

1818
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,799
this algorithm says

1819
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:11,920
you know you're probably going to be

1820
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:13,039
wrong

1821
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:15,359
70 of the time if you pick this kind of

1822
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:17,520
a choice for somebody with this profile

1823
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,200
so that would be amazing

1824
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,240
um

1825
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,599
and then there are other aspects of

1826
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:23,280
course when you're using emrs how do you

1827
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,200
do consent because it's somebody else's

1828
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,400
data

1829
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,559
um especially outside of academic

1830
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:30,640
settings um

1831
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:33,280
um how do you create the appropriate

1832
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,000
training set so that there's the right

1833
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,119
way to look at uh populations and and

1834
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:40,160
use them

1835
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:42,640
um are your conclusions valid

1836
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:45,520
uh how do you test that they're valid um

1837
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,720
and then how do you deal with false

1838
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,240
alarms so maybe you have an alert that

1839
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,240
oh this person's you know going through

1840
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:51,599
some terrible things

1841
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:53,680
but if you're wrong

1842
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,680
how do you deal with that

1843
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,119
um

1844
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,640
so

1845
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,559
one example of what might be a problem

1846
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:02,160
with electronic medical records because

1847
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,319
maybe it seems like a panacea it's like

1848
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:06,240
oh great this is awesome

1849
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,240
uh we're gonna have all this structured

1850
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:11,599
data it's gonna be written by clinicians

1851
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:14,400
so none of that twitter stuff

1852
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,200
well

1853
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,520
this is an example where

1854
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,359
you're able to generate an entire note

1855
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:22,240
with basically

1856
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:24,319
all this text that was generated by the

1857
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:26,799
computer by the system

1858
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:27,839
and

1859
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:30,640
the two parts in yellow are the only

1860
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,480
ones that apparently

1861
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:35,119
came from a provider

1862
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:39,119
a physician or other clinical person

1863
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:40,880
so that's a bit of a problem

1864
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,960
as people are crunched for time

1865
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,520
more and more things get into templates

1866
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:46,559
more things

1867
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:49,280
maybe are formatted automated clicked

1868
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:50,880
into place

1869
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,920
in electronic medical records so now if

1870
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,760
you're going to use

1871
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:59,760
all those fancy algorithms with nlp etc

1872
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,359
on notes

1873
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:03,680
clinician notes like this with the idea

1874
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,039
that hey i'm going to extract something

1875
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:06,240
unique

1876
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,000
well the problem is that uniqueness is

1877
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,960
not coming from what that physician or

1878
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:11,760
other

1879
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,000
clinical person is seeing

1880
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,039
when they

1881
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:17,039
treat the patient

1882
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:19,520
it's coming from the computer

1883
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,520
and it's not entirely clear what that's

1884
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,039
going to do i mean for one thing it

1885
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,799
doesn't seem right it doesn't seem like

1886
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,640
that ought to be the source

1887
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:29,359
of what individualizes our knowledge of

1888
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:31,200
somebody with depression or some other

1889
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,480
condition

1890
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:33,280
so

1891
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:35,599
this is another thing to deal with as we

1892
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:38,640
start to look at alternatives to using

1893
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,319
what has been popular such as social

1894
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:43,119
media

1895
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:45,760
as we talked about lots of uses

1896
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:49,359
but there's a few problems

1897
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,920
then there is another use case where

1898
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,559
again um

1899
01:07:56,559 --> 01:07:59,440
has been implemented in lots of ways

1900
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,640
and that is to have chat bots that

1901
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:05,200
help you cope better so this is going to

1902
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,920
supplement or maybe even completely

1903
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,680
replace

1904
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:10,559
you

1905
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:12,480
speaking with your therapist so these

1906
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,799
are some examples of conversations

1907
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:17,439
between a patient and a chatbot and this

1908
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:20,158
particular one

1909
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:24,238
will talk to you on the basis of

1910
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:25,839
what the emotional threat of your

1911
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:28,560
conversation is

1912
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:32,640
and it will give you what they

1913
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:35,279
say is evidence-based

1914
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:37,040
so they have in their algorithm

1915
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,040
something that uses a certain kind of

1916
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,158
therapy

1917
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:42,238
that's tied to how you use emotional

1918
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:44,158
words and it's supposed to respond

1919
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:47,040
according to those rules

1920
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,359
um

1921
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,600
sounds kind of cool that doesn't work

1922
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,198
well so

1923
01:08:53,198 --> 01:08:54,719
again

1924
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:56,960
the the proof is proof of the pudding is

1925
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,560
in the eating so

1926
01:08:58,560 --> 01:08:59,839
one of the

1927
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:01,679
one example is the randomized control

1928
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:03,279
trial um

1929
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:04,799
so that's a good way to study a problem

1930
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:07,359
like this in this instance a

1931
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:09,040
non-clinical population basically

1932
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,640
college students from a bunch of

1933
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:11,920
universities

1934
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,359
was recruited

1935
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:18,000
each group is about 25-ish people

1936
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,198
and they basically measured

1937
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:23,359
a depression scale

1938
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:24,880
uh which starts off somewhere in the

1939
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,799
region of seven to eight and then

1940
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:29,279
watched it over time the blue

1941
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:31,439
um according to their statistics gets

1942
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:33,359
worse that's the control group

1943
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:34,960
where they give them a website or some

1944
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,960
resource to get information and then the

1945
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,000
other two

1946
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,279
they have access to what they call

1947
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:41,279
integrative ai it's

1948
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:44,158
it's this ai that can kind of work

1949
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:45,120
through

1950
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:48,479
text or messenger or some format and and

1951
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:51,120
basically uh be

1952
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,560
be kind of this

1953
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,800
supportive

1954
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,040
conversational

1955
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,480
chatbot

1956
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,719
and the idea is hey you know it does it

1957
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:03,280
help when you have this

1958
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:06,159
in this case they claim it helps

1959
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:08,000
the ph 9 which is a measure of

1960
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,960
depression goes down

1961
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,760
depressive symptoms goes down over time

1962
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,760
when the chatbot was used interestingly

1963
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,760
not as much when you go to four weeks

1964
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:20,400
than when you go to two

1965
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,640
the problem with this scenario is that

1966
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,080
um

1967
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,560
this is not somebody who has depression

1968
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,320
so it was not

1969
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,080
meant to be that way they didn't ask for

1970
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,080
people with depression

1971
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,320
they asked for volunteers and they said

1972
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,400
hey we're gonna measure your score and

1973
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,400
we'll see what happens

1974
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,360
so

1975
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,560
really

1976
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,719
this may be a model for what needs to be

1977
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:45,440
done but as it stands this type of study

1978
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:46,960
is of limited use because we don't

1979
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,960
really know what it's going to do in

1980
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,080
somebody

1981
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,159
with a clinical diagnosis

1982
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:54,080
but but this is we need a lot more of

1983
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:56,480
this we need large studies

1984
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:59,520
and we need ways of tracking that well

1985
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,520
sounds cool to have a chatbot it doesn't

1986
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:04,560
actually work does it help

1987
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,719
and then again the question would be

1988
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:08,239
where does that

1989
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:11,120
apply and potentially it applies in step

1990
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,040
one and two right so this starts to give

1991
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,800
you you know where can you intervene

1992
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,120
some automated things maybe prevention

1993
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,040
okay so you're not trying to actually

1994
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,719
treat so you don't need a study like

1995
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:21,520
that

1996
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:24,880
but maybe larger longitudinal studies um

1997
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,640
and um

1998
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,960
so maybe there's relief for some

1999
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,560
feedback that the patient can report to

2000
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,239
say oh yeah you know i don't feel

2001
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:33,760
stressed as often during the week for

2002
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:34,800
instance

2003
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,280
so primary prevention

2004
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,520
and then as you go up the spectrum

2005
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,560
you're going to have to provide more and

2006
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,640
more proof for an app that does

2007
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,480
something with somebody who already has

2008
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,800
depression who's in between episodes

2009
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,520
depression that's hard to treat etc

2010
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,719
having problems with access

2011
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:54,960
this is just summarizing what we talked

2012
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,280
about

2013
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,640
so

2014
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,840
hopefully what you've seen so far um as

2015
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,000
we've kind of navigated

2016
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,640
the problem which starts off with

2017
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,600
certain kinds of access issues

2018
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,400
um we didn't talk about really equity in

2019
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,239
that context that's definitely a big

2020
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:17,920
thing in mental health

2021
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:20,239
uh availability of resources as part of

2022
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:23,199
the access problem

2023
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:25,199
and then

2024
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:28,239
in addition to providing

2025
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:29,120
the

2026
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,480
effective

2027
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,159
solution to the mental health problem at

2028
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:34,840
the right time and place

2029
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:38,080
um it's engaging with the patient

2030
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,280
um

2031
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,440
and giving that person

2032
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,400
the the kind of the hook the motivation

2033
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,480
to get through what they're dealing with

2034
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,239
which often comes in a therapeutic

2035
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:49,679
relationship

2036
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:51,679
so

2037
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:53,679
those are the aspects you're trying to

2038
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:55,440
solve for

2039
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,679
because the current outcomes are bad

2040
01:12:57,679 --> 01:12:58,960
and have gotten worse during the

2041
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:01,120
pandemic

2042
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,440
the number of technological solutions

2043
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,920
have really skyrocketed

2044
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:06,800
in

2045
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,760
many of the assessments we've looked at

2046
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,239
those solutions don't seem to

2047
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:14,719
improve over time in the metrics we're

2048
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:16,560
able to look at or

2049
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,520
other folks have looked at

2050
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,120
um

2051
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:21,920
and

2052
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,159
so at this point i think it's important

2053
01:13:24,159 --> 01:13:26,800
to go back to concept and design which

2054
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,400
wasn't getting a lot of traction in one

2055
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,960
of the surveys that we talked about

2056
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,400
and start to say what is it we're

2057
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,000
solving for

2058
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,840
where should this be

2059
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:38,080
in that process of providing mental

2060
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,159
health services

2061
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:41,040
and

2062
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,239
um

2063
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:43,600
what are the specific problems where

2064
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,360
what are the pain points we're trying to

2065
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:47,840
solve for

2066
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,239
otherwise

2067
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:51,920
maybe against all odds you even have a

2068
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,000
great app that does some really useful

2069
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,120
thing

2070
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:56,719
but

2071
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:57,920
if it's not

2072
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,640
easy for it to fit into the system then

2073
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,320
it's not going to be used

2074
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,480
and that's that's no good

2075
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:07,120
so it'll it'll be added to the list of

2076
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:10,719
things out there thousands

2077
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:12,840
that don't make a dent

2078
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:14,400
um

2079
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,880
and so and then finally whatever we do

2080
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,159
hopefully

2081
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:20,000
improves user engagement like we said

2082
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,520
and i think

2083
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:22,800
we've certainly seen that in the

2084
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,120
commercial sector

2085
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,880
technology companies have been

2086
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,400
maybe too good

2087
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,440
at

2088
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:32,719
engaging users to various ends

2089
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:35,520
commercial ends and perhaps it's time to

2090
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:38,480
start to use that

2091
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,480
brain power

2092
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,640
to try to help in mental health

2093
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,800
and help folks engage in

2094
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,719
treatments and

2095
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:48,480
services that can improve their

2096
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,960
well-being so thank you for uh your

2097
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:53,360
attention

2098
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:56,640
thank you so much dr duvari

2099
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:00,320
are there any questions for the cause

2100
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:07,440
so if you have questions maybe you can

2101
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:11,360
enter into the chat room i have one or

2102
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:14,640
two questions so first of all i think

2103
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,800
the diagnosis process is really

2104
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,280
challenging right a lot of things may be

2105
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,280
subjective

2106
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:23,840
we talk about the patients may want to

2107
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:26,640
hide their symptoms right and the second

2108
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,840
thing is even like depression depression

2109
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,960
unlike uh suppose my glucose level is

2110
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:33,840
high

2111
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,000
and you test in the morning in the

2112
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,400
afternoon i think level will tend to be

2113
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,560
high but depression

2114
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:42,719
the mood can swing right you can say in

2115
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:45,199
the morning i'm okay and often i'm i'm

2116
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:46,480
not so okay

2117
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:49,920
and also i sometimes i can be confused

2118
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:53,199
with the unhappiness unhappiness is uh i

2119
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:56,080
see something i don't like it uh

2120
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:58,480
yeah it's nature to be unhappy

2121
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:59,360
but

2122
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:01,760
unhappiness doesn't mean the person is

2123
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,080
in in a depression situation that's not

2124
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,239
correct yeah so when the maya when you

2125
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:08,880
say mild depression uh it's kind of

2126
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,120
challenging so let me let me wrap up

2127
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,800
with the second question because the

2128
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:16,320
purpose of our study mental disorders is

2129
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,880
because we want to understand the

2130
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,120
interactions between consciousness and

2131
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:24,080
unconsciousness so once we study

2132
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,480
some mental disorders

2133
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,800
then it's much easier for us to

2134
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,920
understand what is normal and

2135
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,679
maybe we can

2136
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:35,040
work toward

2137
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:37,040
modeling consciousness

2138
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:41,760
and so for this purpose uh i found uh

2139
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:43,920
deserts work

2140
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,800
essentially optogenetics can be really

2141
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,600
helpful because we want to see oh when

2142
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,679
the person has depression what happened

2143
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:53,040
to the neurons

2144
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:53,760
right

2145
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,400
and what are the stimulus and how this

2146
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,880
person responds to the neurons and one

2147
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,840
of his chapter talking about eating

2148
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:03,520
disorder it's kind of scary to me at the

2149
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,800
same time

2150
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,280
i think promising there because

2151
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,679
it seems like he was saying okay when a

2152
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:12,159
person has mental dis

2153
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:14,960
eating disorder a normal person because

2154
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:16,880
evolution teaches us we have to eat

2155
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:19,120
otherwise we will die right evolution

2156
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:22,000
means uh the purpose of evolution is

2157
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,520
survival first

2158
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:27,199
and then we want to want to just

2159
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:30,640
reproduction so that you can continue so

2160
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:33,120
survival is our nature to say i don't

2161
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:35,920
want to eat right so when you have urge

2162
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:38,159
to eat and this is starting from

2163
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:40,880
unconsciousness we we don't

2164
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,800
try to sense whether i'm hungry or not

2165
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,560
right because physical condition

2166
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,960
triggers my awareness of

2167
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,400
being hungry

2168
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:51,679
and now there's a second set of neurons

2169
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:54,000
in his book he say well

2170
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,199
it happens

2171
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:57,840
a set of neurons get recruited to come

2172
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,080
in to say no you don't want to eat

2173
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,040
because

2174
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:02,560
you are going to get fed and you are

2175
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:05,199
going to be right right and this second

2176
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:06,719
set of neurons

2177
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:09,280
because we often say well this person

2178
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:12,159
has two identities in the body you know

2179
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:13,600
in the past i couldn't understand what's

2180
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,600
going on he said oh this person is evil

2181
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:16,800
processed

2182
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,199
but when when deserts were saying

2183
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:22,400
actually not really because yourself is

2184
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,080
somewhere in the brain

2185
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:26,400
but when this and another cluster of

2186
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,880
neuron got recruited uh this set of

2187
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:33,040
neurons tend to be in your neocortex

2188
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,040
only human being has neocortex right

2189
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,480
animals

2190
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,640
only advanced beams have neural cortex

2191
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,880
so there's these castle neurons

2192
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,560
ask you not to eat

2193
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,480
and this is in the separate cluster of

2194
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:47,120
neurons so oh then i kind of agree i say

2195
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:49,280
okay one cell neuron is your set

2196
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:52,000
yourself the other set of neurons is

2197
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,400
another personality

2198
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,800
and sometimes the second person comes

2199
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,480
out sometimes

2200
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:01,120
yourself is dominating yeah it's not a

2201
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,120
picture this kind of what do you mean

2202
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:06,159
about evil story

2203
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:08,640
from this video

2204
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:11,040
yeah i mean i think they're just like

2205
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:14,400
other mysteries in science or society

2206
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:15,360
that

2207
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,440
you know people

2208
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:21,440
uh used either nature or superstition to

2209
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:24,159
explain i think this this fits right so

2210
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,800
for instance you could imagine somebody

2211
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,440
who has an epileptic seizure

2212
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:31,360
as being one version of possessed you

2213
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:32,880
know it's somebody who

2214
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,120
shakes violently has foaming in their

2215
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:36,880
mouth and you know i mean that's sort of

2216
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,320
like oh you know how do you make sense

2217
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:39,280
of this

2218
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:41,920
um and and you can make a story as to

2219
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,000
why that person is doing it and maybe

2220
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,760
there's cause and effect as opposed to a

2221
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:46,880
brain

2222
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:50,800
uh disorder similarly uh somebody who

2223
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,480
suddenly

2224
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,080
you know is presenting a psychotic

2225
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,760
southern suddenly to you maybe it's

2226
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,679
quietly been building

2227
01:19:57,679 --> 01:19:59,600
similarly with eating disorders

2228
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,840
um you know in treatment we'll often

2229
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,679
refer to refer to that aspect as the

2230
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:06,159
eating disorder voice right and and and

2231
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:07,840
one of the critical aspects of treatment

2232
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,600
is separation from the eating disorder

2233
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:13,760
voice so is that person able to observe

2234
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:16,719
this eating disorder voice not be

2235
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:19,440
one with it and then influence how they

2236
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:22,560
cope and then ultimately overcome it

2237
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,239
so

2238
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:26,639
absolutely if we're if we dial the clock

2239
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:29,120
back probably not that long ago

2240
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,120
you're you're basically exercising

2241
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,280
demons i mean

2242
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,800
there is

2243
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,320
not a long

2244
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:37,360
gap

2245
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,840
between those concepts yeah these are

2246
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,600
this one's promises

2247
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,040
if you know where

2248
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:45,600
your your class of neurons your demon

2249
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,120
are or is

2250
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,040
they and using

2251
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:51,679
uh optogenetics you can turn them off

2252
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:53,280
you can turn them turn the turn the

2253
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:56,000
neurons off that's interesting anyway so

2254
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,280
so uh because of starting consciousness

2255
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:03,679
uh one relevant topic would be dementia

2256
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:07,120
or alzheimer's diseases or maybe uh

2257
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,360
artisan right

2258
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:12,000
so for dementia this is getting worse

2259
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,080
and worse because we are living longer

2260
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:15,440
and longer

2261
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:19,120
and how to keep your neuron uh healthy

2262
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:21,440
and why people lose their memory and

2263
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:24,080
this is one another phenomena is uh a

2264
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,159
lot of a lot of kids will say well my

2265
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:28,480
parents get into dementia but my parents

2266
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:32,000
can can recognize the chao givers but

2267
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,320
they cannot recognize me right that's

2268
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,560
kind of very very sad

2269
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:38,320
but but if you really know how the

2270
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,880
neurons work for memory that could be

2271
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,639
explained and that's actually quite

2272
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:44,400
interesting so we are trying to study

2273
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,600
all these

2274
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,320
interesting topics yes yeah yeah no i

2275
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,000
think i think there's a

2276
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,320
there is basically this

2277
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:55,920
potential uh to tease apart the layers

2278
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,239
of memory because you could think that

2279
01:21:58,239 --> 01:21:59,600
you know maybe

2280
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,199
you know at least in clinical experience

2281
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:03,360
the so-called autobiographical memories

2282
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:06,239
and tends to persist for a long time

2283
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:08,639
uh even when you're losing short-term

2284
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:11,760
memory so building new memories and so

2285
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,719
yeah maybe it's possible that we can

2286
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:15,679
learn

2287
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:17,679
the structure of that to the point where

2288
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:20,320
you can sort of see oh look there's this

2289
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,639
layering of how

2290
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:25,600
uh you know maybe not physically but

2291
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,440
conceptually there's this layering of

2292
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:30,480
how memories are put into place

2293
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:34,080
uh over autobiographical time

2294
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,719
uh as one concept or maybe you know

2295
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:38,960
other people have other

2296
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:41,520
structured ways of looking at this as in

2297
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,280
uh you know there's short-term memories

2298
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,880
that need to go through this process to

2299
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,880
become consolidated and once they're

2300
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:50,400
consolidated they're a little less

2301
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:53,280
perturbable whereas if it's in the short

2302
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,120
term period then there's a lot you can

2303
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:57,199
do to it so there are different

2304
01:22:57,199 --> 01:22:59,440
constructs of how they've been modeled

2305
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:02,480
uh so to your point i think as that can

2306
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:04,000
be tweaked more whether it's with

2307
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,480
optogenetics or other tools

2308
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,159
we might be able to tell

2309
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:10,480
and then similarly

2310
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:12,800
i think for any range of things in

2311
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,400
psychiatry where

2312
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,840
essentially you're looking at a break

2313
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,920
from reality right so psychosis is

2314
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:20,239
obviously a clear example eating

2315
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:22,080
disorder is another version of that

2316
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,920
which is in some ways

2317
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,840
very curious because

2318
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,840
that person is not psychotic in the

2319
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,760
general sense

2320
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,920
they're perfectly fine in terms of being

2321
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:34,159
able to tell reality from not in all

2322
01:23:34,159 --> 01:23:36,239
these different ways except for this one

2323
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:37,280
aspect

2324
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:38,000
so

2325
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
how do you do that in the architecture

2326
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,920
of the brain right

2327
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,920
where you would think if you're breaking

2328
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:45,760
from reality that really needs to be

2329
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:48,320
this general phenomenon

2330
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,159
that but in fact that doesn't seem to be

2331
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:52,400
the case so yeah i i agree with you i

2332
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:55,520
think as as you can tease apart um some

2333
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,560
of those contract constructs it may

2334
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:02,400
start to give you maybe a fundamental

2335
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:03,440
uh

2336
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:04,239
set

2337
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:06,639
of circuits that are kind of our

2338
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:08,239
baseline

2339
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:10,880
uh way of keeping the brain functional

2340
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,120
and aware and all the characteristics

2341
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,400
that people talk about when they talk

2342
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,560
about consciousness uh

2343
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,239
and then maybe

2344
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:19,600
uh

2345
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,080
a lot of the day-to-day behaviors and

2346
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,840
functions we think about are actually

2347
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,120
overlays

2348
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:26,639
uh they're they're not kind of the

2349
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:28,560
essential aspects of consciousness

2350
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,639
they're are sort of these

2351
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:33,360
not quite extra but additional

2352
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:36,560
uh layers and so maybe psychiatry by

2353
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:37,840
kind of

2354
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,760
pulling off some of those functions in

2355
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,040
these different

2356
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,840
disorders is able to

2357
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:46,000
inform because then that common

2358
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,120
set of inter the intersection set will

2359
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,639
basically tell you okay all of these

2360
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:52,400
things have consciousness

2361
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,480
so which means that as you delete these

2362
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,080
various things

2363
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:58,560
whatever you then delete and still

2364
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,159
retain consciousness is actually

2365
01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:02,560
informing you about what is that

2366
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:04,239
that intersection

2367
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:05,679
um

2368
01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:07,040
that maybe helps you to find at least

2369
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,840
some circuits um and then go from there

2370
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:12,800
yeah no fascinating yes so thank you so

2371
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,719
much dr davari and dr daryl will come

2372
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:16,239
back in nine days

2373
01:25:16,239 --> 01:25:20,639
to wrap up uh the part of psychiatry

2374
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:23,600
and if you have any questions just maybe

2375
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,920
send me your questions i can aggregate

2376
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:28,560
them and look forward to dr duvari thank

2377
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,239
you so much and

2378
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:33,440
i will see you on thursday next week

2379
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:34,320
all right

2380
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:37,639
okay bye
