1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,960
hi good morning everyone

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,720
today's lecture we are going to cover

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,559
privacy preservation

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,280
machine learning uh privacy is a very

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,400
critical issue

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,920
i would talk about the reasons

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,160
regulations

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,640
approaches and finally one of the

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,840
solutions

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,039
stanford has implemented uh before we

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,519
get started let's talk about this uh

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,439
our presentation schedule uh we have two

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,160
uh classes uh open for sign up

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,680
next tuesday and the next thursday

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,480
and each presentation is expected to be

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,239
about 30 minutes

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,239
so if you your time cannot accommodate

18
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:46,960
to this

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,800
to uh presentation epochs

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,440
we can accommodate a scheduling other

21
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,399
time

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,879
but it should be before uh the time we

23
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,480
need to turn in the

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,760
your grades and also just a reminder

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,960
please uh

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,080
do cost evaluation and this is

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,280
reminding me by the register uh

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,280
we would like to really appreciate your

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,280
comments suggestions

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,240
so for the next addition we can make

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,520
improvement

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,320
or basically what we have done right and

33
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:20,960
what

34
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,680
you expect us to improve let us know

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,360
and remaining lectures today

36
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,280
again we cover privacy preserving

37
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,720
machine learning

38
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,840
and this thursday and

39
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,479
we had covered already consciousness and

40
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,640
we are going to wrap up consciousness

41
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,159
get into mind and ethics these are two

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,360
very critical subjects but at the same

43
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,200
time very abstract

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,280
but i plan to root on psychology

45
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,799
and maybe physics right to give you

46
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,119
some of the perspectives from quantum

47
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,240
mechanics

48
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,079
and maybe even from religions

49
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,640
perspective

50
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,680
okay to this outline we are going to

51
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,160
start

52
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,038
cover the major concerns about privacy

53
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,640
from users perspective

54
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,000
and also from companies perspectives

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and the privacy regulations the key

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
regulations are ccpa

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,680
and gdpr and we plan to explain

58
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,640
them in details and also in the medical

59
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,280
domain

60
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,440
right we have we have another set of

61
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,720
regulations

62
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,000
but they are pretty similar uh then

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,120
from this compliance requirements if we

64
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,120
cannot comply as a company

65
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,000
the company may be fined heavily so we

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,800
have to

67
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,959
understand the complex requirement and

68
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,000
convert the

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,640
requirement into execution requirements

70
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,560
and we must have heard about

71
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,920
like federated learning or differential

72
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,800
learning will those implementation

73
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,920
fulfill the

74
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,159
regulation requirements or not i

75
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,760
personally consider they are not

76
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,560
adequate but it's really hard to say

77
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,599
until

78
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,959
a company and was a company will be

79
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,959
brought to the lawsuit situation

80
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,000
the court eventually will clarify

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,120
the boundary of the regulations so

82
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,599
we enumerate three major technical

83
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,720
approaches

84
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,360
to be able to preserve privacy and

85
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,400
finally

86
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,239
uh i mentioned this is a standard system

87
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,000
called saltaria

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,720
it's called developed by by stanford and

89
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,640
also my previous colleagues

90
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,840
and use this blockchain to safeguarding

91
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,879
privacy so privacy

92
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,640
for sure we know that they say using

93
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,560
cell phone using laptop

94
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,080
whatever information we enter we will be

95
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,319
tracked right so there's a trade-off

96
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,200
between

97
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,519
free usage applications and you have to

98
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,799
give us something

99
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,519
and in certain situations if you don't

100
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:56,720
give up your information

101
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,400
the application cannot be run like

102
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,480
google maps right google maps you say i

103
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,840
want to about

104
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,200
uh location tracking then good luck

105
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,640
uh it just cannot be functioning so but

106
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,680
other applications like news so i i'm

107
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,159
consulting a japanese company right now

108
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,399
and they are worried about if they track

109
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,160
your reading patterns

110
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,639
uh what will be the regulation

111
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,759
ramifications

112
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,880
right so in certain applications the

113
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,960
yes or no between yes and no the

114
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,199
boundaries is kind of tricky

115
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,240
and the sale giant vehicle for sure

116
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,280
uh he has been collecting tons of data

117
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,000
and uh take tesla as an example if you

118
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,120
see the fine print

119
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,840
behind the vehicle you can see uh it

120
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,040
collects your

121
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,759
battery status temperature inside

122
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,840
outside your location

123
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,120
also in this level two uh cell driving

124
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,400
they have to track

125
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,120
the user's status right if a user is

126
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,479
dozing off

127
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,040
they quickly they will just turn off

128
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,639
self-driving mode

129
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,880
and all those information potentially

130
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,000
where you are

131
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,479
and what is your conversation even in

132
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,360
the car

133
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,080
uh they will track and for instance if

134
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,880
you are

135
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,280
in they say in some countries you get

136
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,639
into a taxi

137
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,360
and everything uh you you kind of

138
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,400
conduct

139
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,400
in that tennessee in that space uh

140
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,720
it's not personal information it's

141
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,160
actually private

142
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,960
and so when we talk about healthcare we

143
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,199
introduce this tricorder device

144
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,479
with a number of uh medical iots

145
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,560
and all those information such as the

146
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,919
walking pattern and the the ecg

147
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:42,800
information

148
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,160
on apple watch right those data

149
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,280
is being collected and utilized

150
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,320
and frankly i have no idea who is using

151
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,880
my

152
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,080
uh ecg data and will

153
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,120
apple resell my data to

154
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,240
other companies at this point i'm just

155
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,280
totally clueless

156
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,240
right so it would be nice to be informed

157
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,840
what kind of data is being collected

158
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,800
from me

159
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,240
and to to which party the data

160
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,240
will be sold and although as part of

161
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,360
stanford over

162
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,440
we're doing this virtual system and

163
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,039
virtual assistant will become

164
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,960
more and more popular even you don't

165
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,199
have a speaker just talk to

166
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,759
your computer through siri the

167
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,680
information is being collected

168
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,560
and all these speakers suppose we turn

169
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,360
them off

170
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,440
they are still sort of listening right

171
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,880
because they need to be

172
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,080
be waken up to perform their duties

173
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,960
so conversations at home uh will be

174
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,840
recorded

175
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,319
so one situation i got into this was

176
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,160
about a week ago

177
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,280
i went up to the dish and i came home

178
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,680
and i i feel i feel my knees

179
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,840
were hurting so i i on the one hand i'm

180
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,880
searching for remedies for

181
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,360
heating my knees at the same time i also

182
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,520
talked to my wife about the situation

183
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,800
and suddenly facebook uh prompt this

184
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,759
video to me so that was very spooky

185
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,479
right

186
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,479
uh so this could be one of two

187
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,080
situations one was

188
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,840
facebook sue macbook

189
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,319
was listening to me and the second thing

190
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,720
is maybe i was typing something

191
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,199
in real time the information was

192
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,560
transmitted to

193
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,800
facebook and facebook do this kind of

194
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,680
real-time

195
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,639
matching so this is uh to me is a kind

196
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,240
of horrible experience means

197
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,400
well in real time people can target me

198
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,080
or you can say this is a blessing i have

199
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,720
this health health concern and someone

200
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,039
is

201
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,800
really caring for me so

202
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,199
top consumer privacy concerns so yes i

203
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,479
do have a lot of concerns

204
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,680
this is a survey conducted by

205
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,400
some agencies and you can search all

206
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,759
these kind of different surveys on the

207
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,479
internet

208
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,639
so i summarize some key concerns one is

209
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,240
definitely identity

210
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,759
theft it's not really changing these

211
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,560
days

212
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,160
even you say i want to anonymize myself

213
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,919
but still do cross-court correlation

214
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,400
the if people really want to target you

215
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,520
individually

216
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,240
they could get your pi information

217
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,360
personal identifying

218
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,919
the information and the private data

219
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,360
then will be made

220
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,080
public and this is really bad for

221
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,039
especially

222
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,719
politicians even for us right it is not

223
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,760
a glamorous glimmer situation

224
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,919
and data can be sold and distributed

225
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,200
without our knowledge

226
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,519
and certain data especially medical data

227
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,800
could be valuable

228
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,000
so when data being sold people will be

229
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
willing to sell the data for

230
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,560
revenue or for charity but they'd like

231
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,279
to

232
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,320
know the fact the data has been used

233
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,040
and the safety if my location can always

234
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,320
be tracked

235
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,680
then if people want to impose harm

236
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,360
to myself and that's kind of

237
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,720
not a converting situation so

238
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,480
let's enumerate some details of ccpa

239
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,560
and the gdpr regulations so gdpr

240
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,080
was is established by european union and

241
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,959
ccpa

242
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,760
was passed by california congress

243
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,720
about two years ago then the was become

244
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,839
active

245
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,760
january 2020 and they gave

246
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,880
all the companies some great spirit to

247
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,160
implement it

248
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,600
and currently as i if if my

249
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,000
information is not obsolete means if a

250
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,720
consumer

251
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,160
asks for certain privacy related actions

252
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,519
to be constructed by a company let's

253
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,000
like erase my assets history

254
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,560
the company has to respond in about

255
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,839
three months

256
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,880
so because the regulation was just

257
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,800
was just out there last year so

258
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,079
therefore they gave this

259
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,760
long grace period for all the companies

260
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,079
to get their ad together and recently

261
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,320
when you access certain sites you

262
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,279
started to get

263
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,760
a pop-up like can i use your cookie can

264
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,760
i track your cookie and so on so forth

265
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,279
those are pretty much because of a ccpa

266
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,440
and lawyers agree ccpa although was

267
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,760
initiated in california but will be

268
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,640
widely

269
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,800
adopted by other states very very soon

270
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,160
so like i mentioned ccpa started

271
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,680
last year and some terms let's

272
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,320
define them so when we discuss all the

273
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,360
implementations

274
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,560
we will be on the same page so here we

275
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,680
say person

276
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,920
person we talk about uh juris prudence

277
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,279
uh nature person just like the person

278
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,880
with with the body

279
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,360
with temperature right it's not like a

280
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,079
business

281
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,279
business kind of unit so

282
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,839
personal information defined by

283
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:08,959
information that can

284
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,040
identify or relates to describes

285
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,800
is reasonable capable of being

286
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,399
associated with

287
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,000
a real person so this

288
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,680
kind of personal information could

289
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,200
include my

290
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,560
address ids and

291
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,880
several other things and we talk about

292
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,240
more

293
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,240
in later slides and then to

294
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,120
start the data imagine data we divide

295
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,720
the people into

296
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,519
uh kind of three two or three categories

297
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,360
why is the people need to manage data

298
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,680
right data we call data subject

299
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,360
and the data controller is a person

300
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,600
who determines the process of managing

301
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,399
the data

302
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,720
and set up the sop standard operation

303
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,600
process

304
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,959
for processing data and data processors

305
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,040
are the people who are instructed by

306
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,320
data controllers

307
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,360
to process the data so

308
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,200
basically you have controller and

309
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,959
processor they play

310
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,360
different roles okay and

311
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,200
pi personal information is divided by

312
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,680
a few categories one is personal

313
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,120
information strictly

314
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,519
prohibited to disclose including a

315
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,040
person's religion

316
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,560
genetics biometric health healthcare

317
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,680
data and ids and there there are more

318
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,279
and some data they are anonymized

319
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,480
right so suppose you have a database

320
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,680
storing a person's name and then all the

321
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,959
personal information plus their access

322
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:47,519
history

323
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,720
access means i say i access a news

324
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,440
website the asset history will be all

325
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,720
the news i've read

326
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,000
in the last let's say several weeks so

327
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,399
you like to be able to anonymize not

328
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,240
really the assets patterns

329
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,800
but my pi personal information need to

330
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
be anonymized

331
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,279
and another category is pseudo

332
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,399
anonymized

333
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,279
so even let's say you anonymize my

334
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,320
record

335
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,600
but still using some mechanisms

336
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,320
i can still re-engineering or

337
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,920
re-identify

338
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,279
that person right i will give an example

339
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,200
shortly so basically suppose i have your

340
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,320
address

341
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,519
and that's very very simple i have your

342
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,160
gender

343
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,360
and maybe your working location

344
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,639
maybe it's not too hard to pin down uh

345
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,519
your identity even not yourself per se

346
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,240
but can profile you into a specific

347
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,079
group

348
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,680
so this is a example

349
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,800
suppose you have data stored

350
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,000
by let's say facebook or google and

351
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,600
they need to worry about two things one

352
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,120
is how to store

353
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,240
data and the second thing is how the

354
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,279
data will be

355
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,639
accessed right and the storage because

356
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,639
when you store data data will be used

357
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,800
so how the data gets stored can affect

358
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,000
privacy

359
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,040
so let's say you have your

360
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,320
database table which consists of

361
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,120
personal information and like i

362
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,079
mentioned some

363
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,399
access history you have to separate the

364
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,680
two into two

365
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,279
tables and do it to a join and the only

366
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,000
data controller can see both tables

367
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,160
and the data processor can only touch on

368
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,360
the table with only data data history

369
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,160
but with rpi information okay so you

370
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,199
kind of reduce

371
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,720
the number of people who can touch the

372
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,079
pi information and oh

373
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,560
even let's say data controller can

374
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,480
access pi information

375
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,079
and all the assets must be locked

376
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,839
and locked on indebted record for future

377
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,160
audit so here one important point

378
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,440
sticks out is indelible record

379
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,959
for audit and the auditing process must

380
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:13,600
be

381
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,600
transparent and must be trusted

382
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,639
and all the actions done by this

383
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,680
dc and also

384
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,079
need to be provable right so you say

385
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,000
yeah i did it i did this and

386
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,199
that but that's your verbal claims but

387
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:31,680
when

388
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,199
fcc audits a company they want to see

389
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,639
provable evidence

390
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,000
so privacy governance

391
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,040
and the policy

392
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,279
clearly returned to cover the following

393
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,880
so i will talk about

394
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,279
uh gdpr and ccpa separately but they are

395
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,040
very similar

396
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,240
only about one or two items they are

397
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,040
they have slight differences so the

398
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,040
policy clearly written

399
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,600
uh just sent to the user user need to

400
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,399
consent the policy has to cover

401
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,680
what data the site collects from the

402
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,800
user

403
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,680
and the collection method mechanism how

404
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,360
data will be used

405
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,320
and what the user will receive as an

406
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:20,959
exchange

407
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,399
right so for example your you would

408
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,680
give more accurate ads as an

409
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,440
exchange whether you like it or not you

410
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,959
can make a decision

411
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,320
and where the data has been stored and

412
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,000
where the data be shared and share with

413
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,240
whom so this

414
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,440
required information must be stated

415
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,199
in in the privacy policy and

416
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,519
some consent must be is pleasingly given

417
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,240
by the data subject and you cannot just

418
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,440
say i give you this

419
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,639
policy with 10 items and

420
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,560
then you say well you have to agree with

421
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,880
either or or nothing

422
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,279
so the key thing here is that by default

423
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,640
all the items

424
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,319
will be opt out and we have to itemize

425
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,280
each collected data item separately and

426
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,599
then

427
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,880
there's no bundle agreement and the user

428
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,679
has to

429
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,799
click each one of them to say either i

430
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,280
accept your collection of my data

431
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,640
collecting my data

432
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,000
or not right so no box

433
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,120
can be pre-checked and the option is

434
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,919
up out and the user can come in to

435
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:32,960
select

436
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,919
the items they feel comfortable about

437
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,840
and they can always come back to

438
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,440
uh about okay so everything has to be

439
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,360
done explicitly that's the key

440
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,720
so unlike currently many consumer

441
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,840
activities

442
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,360
you will be given a huge or

443
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,320
huge huge deck of documents and you you

444
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,520
are required to sign

445
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,840
to finish signing within 10 or 20

446
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,720
minutes

447
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,440
especially let's say you buy a house or

448
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:01,840
you

449
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,720
can even buy a car and the contract

450
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,840
agreement

451
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,960
a few pages and you just cannot

452
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,400
see all the details of or fine prints

453
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,320
within the the pressure timing

454
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,919
okay the second uh information

455
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,280
pieces specifically cover uh gdpr

456
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,000
it's european regulations and the

457
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,679
consumer has right

458
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,440
to write of inform right any data

459
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,280
being accessed must be be told

460
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,919
and the right of assets must be granted

461
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:38,960
by the user

462
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,200
and right the user has right to erase to

463
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,320
be forgotten

464
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,720
and right of data probability if i want

465
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,000
to move my data from

466
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,880
hospital a to hospital b b you cannot

467
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,600
say no

468
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,679
you have to let me do it right to

469
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,600
restrict data processing

470
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,880
and write to object and data processing

471
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,440
can you you can you can even be very

472
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,880
specific saying okay

473
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,280
my gender information or my age

474
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,480
information

475
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,400
should not be revealed right to

476
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,120
rectification means i can make changes

477
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,799
to my personal information

478
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,440
and right to reject automated individual

479
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,559
decision making

480
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,880
or profiling or even as targeting

481
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,039
and ccpa as i said uh the

482
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,520
b of rights are very similar to gdpr

483
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,120
except for two items

484
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,240
so i highlight in in red the first here

485
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:32,880
is

486
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,440
know whether their personal data is sold

487
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,799
or disclosed

488
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,799
and if so to whom okay and gdpr didn't

489
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:41,200
say

490
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,000
not specifically but ccpa is saying well

491
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,600
if your data has been sold

492
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,400
you have to tell the the owner

493
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,520
explicitly

494
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,240
and this is probably because of the a

495
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:52,720
few

496
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,840
problems happen in in the past years and

497
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,120
i have some examples to show you

498
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,559
shortly and the final one is is a little

499
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,320
bit dicey it's got

500
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,760
not to be discriminated and

501
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,880
i could understand it until uh the the

502
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,240
company's smart news

503
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,480
and try to implement the privacy uh

504
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,360
rules

505
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,280
so so smart news in the usually say well

506
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,320
our privacy data store in the back back

507
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,400
end is very convoluted

508
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,360
so if we really need to be in compliance

509
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,120
then we have to

510
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,440
redesign the database schemas we have to

511
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,960
do this data

512
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,799
downloading reloading this will take

513
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,159
some time so why don't we do a shortcut

514
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,919
we just tell the users who up out

515
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,440
this kind of access data agreement

516
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,720
we just say okay sorry you cannot use

517
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,640
our application anymore and basically

518
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,840
you install them

519
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,440
they install their applications from

520
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,760
their phone or from your desktop

521
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,799
and from ccps percent perspective

522
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,720
you cannot do that because this means

523
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,000
you are discriminating

524
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,280
certain users they are not waiting

525
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,159
to let you collect their data but why

526
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:08,880
this is

527
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,559
very kind of dicey because suppose uh

528
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,679
in the situation of google maps right

529
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,679
so you say okay i'm not going to allow

530
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,200
you to track my

531
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,640
location so you say oh then i cannot

532
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,440
give you

533
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,400
uh driving direction that's not really

534
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,159
discriminating against you that's

535
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,400
i cannot serve you because i don't have

536
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,320
certain information about your

537
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,799
your situation there's no way i can give

538
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:35,360
you

539
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,159
a reasonable prediction of your of your

540
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:38,880
next

541
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,400
driving uh direction so

542
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,080
another scenario you can say the

543
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,600
opposite let's say

544
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,559
i have this application i want to charge

545
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,679
you for let's say

546
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,440
subscription fee 10 a month

547
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,480
but if you allow me to access your data

548
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,520
then it's free so then then this

549
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,000
if you if you have this kind of kind of

550
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,520
the over

551
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,960
it's hard to say whether you are

552
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,280
discriminating against a user or not

553
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,000
right so all these kind of boundary

554
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,520
conditions

555
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,360
we can interpret right now but

556
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,360
eventually will be interpreted by

557
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,600
the law of the core of the law

558
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,440
so finally a very subtle point but it's

559
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,880
extremely critical is

560
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,440
i'm not going to read this at all

561
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,240
details

562
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,320
the critical thing is you have to be

563
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,679
able to

564
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,159
write all your privacy safeguarding

565
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,280
actions

566
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,280
somewhere and eventually your actions

567
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,720
have to be provable so give your example

568
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,840
this a person

569
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,039
x requested company y to erase

570
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,240
is or probably consent via email

571
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,240
and companywide did not fulfill the

572
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,280
request

573
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,120
and but claim they claim that they have

574
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,039
done the request

575
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,520
right so you say okay erase my data i

576
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,720
say oh i did it

577
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,360
but i actually did not so how can you

578
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,400
prove it

579
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,960
and you can get into this uh he says

580
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,240
she's a situation

581
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,200
that would be very convoluted so the law

582
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,240
requires

583
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,280
the company has to be able to prove they

584
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,559
have done all the

585
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,200
processes to safeguarding the user's

586
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,000
privacy

587
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,440
so let's come back and talk about

588
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,440
probability in the end

589
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,280
and these are some landmark cases of

590
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,400
privacy positive violation and the

591
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,080
consequences

592
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,760
on the top row you see in the beginning

593
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,400
or

594
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,600
uh maybe a couple of years ago uber was

595
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,720
fined for

596
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,840
148 million by eu so

597
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,039
the top line was a violation of

598
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,640
gdpr and then there was a

599
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,919
230 million dollars fine

600
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,279
from british airway and

601
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,640
the most recent one was ftc

602
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,919
versus facebook and facebook was fine by

603
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,840
five billion dollars and

604
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,559
the bottom is of course is the case

605
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,240
happened just last year

606
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,400
uh ftc brought a lawsuit against

607
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,520
google youtube and google youtube did

608
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,440
not send consent

609
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,799
to children's parent for accessing

610
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,799
children's data right so this is also

611
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,679
kind of complicated because for minors

612
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:34,080
uh

613
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,320
they don't have even they say well i

614
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,200
agree

615
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,279
you collect my data but they don't

616
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,640
really have they don't they don't have a

617
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,520
sufficient uh

618
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,840
ability to make such a judgment so the

619
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,360
concern should be sent to

620
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,320
parents then this was google was swined

621
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:48,960
by

622
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,080
170 million dollars

623
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,880
so a very uh tricky situation here was

624
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,360
some company they would say okay i get

625
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,799
fined by

626
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,000
ftc or some agencies for

627
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,480
millions of dollars but on the other

628
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,440
hand

629
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,400
because of the information i can earn

630
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,400
billions of dollars

631
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,520
so for some companies they will say

632
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,960
well this is cost of sales

633
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,000
i don't know whether you have heard

634
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,240
about this term or not um

635
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,000
like one example i can provide is

636
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,720
like google use page rank in the

637
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,600
beginning

638
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,039
and then they do this ad words

639
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,919
right if you you can buy words on search

640
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:36,720
terms

641
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,320
on google and the patents of adwords

642
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,600
was owned by a european company

643
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,120
so if you implement it without licensing

644
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,480
then you'll be fined heavily but

645
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,600
if you want to license it and there's a

646
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,080
cost

647
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,919
so how can you deal with the situation

648
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,279
right so that's

649
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,960
when that happens that's a consideration

650
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,799
i'll say yeah let me let me just

651
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,880
violate it if uh it's not working then i

652
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,520
just

653
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,000
uh during this kind of disagreement or

654
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,880
dispute

655
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,080
i can just drop it but if i make huge

656
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,279
profit about it

657
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,840
then i can just pay the fine because at

658
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,559
the end i'm

659
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,320
earning more than then my my loss

660
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,960
so that was very uh that kind of act was

661
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,360
very non-ethical but

662
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,039
it's it's actually in practice okay

663
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,120
now we want to say you talk about all

664
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,640
these compliance requirements

665
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,279
how can we implement it and be very

666
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,320
careful

667
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,400
there are many methods presented out

668
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,440
there

669
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,960
but os on mine is one even

670
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,000
the policy has been implemented

671
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,200
can private private information still be

672
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,679
re-identified or people can do reverse

673
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,880
engineer to

674
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,200
find out who you are or which group you

675
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,000
belong to

676
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,400
right so that's one thing to consider

677
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,120
the second

678
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,880
thing to consider is again the

679
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,400
probability

680
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,120
and trust right so you say you had done

681
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,320
that but

682
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,440
prove me how did you do it and when did

683
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,919
you do it

684
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,039
so the execution to comply

685
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,559
consists of uh five steps one is you

686
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,159
have to delegate

687
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,840
an oversight committee in a company

688
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,080
so this is just not saying say i have

689
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,880
done that

690
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,399
so when ftc orders a company my previous

691
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,320
company was audited by

692
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,919
ftc so when they came in they say hey

693
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,320
give me all the documents to show you do

694
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,840
have an oversight committee

695
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,039
who they are and these people do exist

696
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,720
okay and they they map the data you have

697
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,760
collected

698
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,960
to your usage and storage so where do

699
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,080
you store data

700
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,960
can you show us the document and how the

701
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,600
data

702
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,640
has been used so it's definitely hard

703
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,360
for ftc to really get into your database

704
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,120
to look around but they want to see

705
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,559
documentations

706
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,679
and then do you have this sop for your

707
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,960
employees right so all the regulation we

708
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,000
talk about

709
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,120
do you have this compliance process for

710
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,919
your

711
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,279
data controller and also data processors

712
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,240
if frankly you don't even have a process

713
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,120
in place

714
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,919
then everything is just talking and do

715
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,840
you have your personnel divided

716
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,880
into dc and the dpe

717
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,520
and also specifying their roles very

718
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,240
clearly

719
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,240
right and sop for serving consumers when

720
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,279
consumers

721
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,399
is served did you really give them this

722
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,000
kind of contract to sign

723
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,640
so allow them to open an about and

724
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,159
compile with all these

725
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:55,360
required items and finally probability

726
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,399
let's look at the technique technical

727
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,080
approaches so

728
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,919
the first one is very uh understandable

729
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,080
you say i just anonymize the data right

730
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,120
then we have this

731
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,240
differential privacy was popular before

732
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:10,799
cc

733
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,159
uh ccpa uh was activated

734
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,640
and the federated learning is still very

735
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,440
popular

736
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,399
and google was was pushing that uh

737
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,520
pushing this back

738
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,360
this is this effort and quite a few

739
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,120
papers have been published

740
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,760
uh on this particular subject then

741
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,799
finally

742
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,080
talk about distributed ledgers so

743
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,240
anonymized versus pseudo anonymization

744
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,880
there are some subtle differences so

745
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,559
anonymization means

746
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,919
if i even i look at the the data or sql

747
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:44,640
table

748
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,440
i have no idea who is that particular

749
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,399
person so

750
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,440
basically just hide all the personal

751
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,240
identifiable information right so

752
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,279
including

753
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,720
excel already your gender your

754
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,960
profession and so on so forth

755
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,159
so but even let's say data has been

756
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,600
anonymized uh still could be

757
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,320
re-engineered to find out who is a

758
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,159
person for instance

759
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,600
uh let's say cell phone would track my

760
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,640
locations so he knows in the daytime i

761
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,320
will be in certain locations around

762
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,440
stanford

763
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,799
so for sure i think uh

764
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,000
the google maps will say oh edward is

765
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,320
affiliated with stanford university and

766
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,080
he lives in palo alto

767
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,760
right and from the duration i

768
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,720
stay in a particular location they say i

769
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,559
stay in the gates building

770
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,960
but i'm not moving around very

771
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,919
frequently

772
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,559
i mean at one spot for more than one

773
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:45,279
hours

774
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,559
so easily to infer well

775
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,640
maybe you are not a student yes a

776
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,000
student will be moving around

777
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,480
to different classrooms but maybe you

778
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,679
are a staff

779
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,120
or a faculty member right so

780
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,039
if you say oh every every other days

781
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,360
you will show up at a particular

782
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,159
building

783
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,159
and for about one hour and a half now

784
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,919
say okay it's more likely

785
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,559
you are a professor rather than the

786
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:13,440
staff

787
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,960
so see you have not really disclosed any

788
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,279
information explicitly you only have

789
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,320
this person's

790
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,720
moving patterns but already you got lots

791
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,399
of information from this person

792
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,720
right and the another example is on

793
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,399
facebook you say i'm not going to give

794
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:29,120
you any

795
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,679
of my personal information including my

796
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:32,720
birthday

797
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,760
and where i live but

798
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,679
unfortunately if you have your social

799
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,919
networks and you are interacting with

800
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:40,799
people

801
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,159
uh about 20 some years old

802
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,200
and they are college students

803
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,240
and most of them are from ucla it's not

804
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,840
really hard to infer

805
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,880
you should be in in high probability you

806
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,159
are ucla student

807
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,320
right then with other information

808
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,440
probably not stored

809
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,159
in that particular app then people can

810
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,600
identify you

811
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,440
so because i'm in this news business

812
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,919
now you know when you do ads targeting

813
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,840
if you just use the user's

814
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,039
news data itself so i was joking with

815
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:15,519
our

816
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,559
engineers i say well i i read

817
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,320
uh election news let's say i'm either

818
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:22,799
pro

819
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,320
republican or pro democrats just based

820
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:26,880
on

821
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,000
either i go to cnn or fox news can you

822
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,919
target me with ads

823
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,960
right this is just ridiculous if i i'm a

824
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,679
democrat

825
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,080
do you sell me tesla or do you want to

826
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,679
sell me for

827
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,320
it's not very clear so i said well news

828
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,320
data news reading history

829
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,640
using those to target ads is kind of

830
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,840
ridiculous

831
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,880
but then all companies would buy

832
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,200
information data information from

833
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,320
browsers

834
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,440
from other sources and the facebook

835
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,200
information i just gave you

836
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,000
i was doing a search on google i was not

837
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,440
doing a search on facebook

838
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,440
i would never do a search on facebook

839
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,200
saying oh my knee hurts

840
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,200
what should i do i did a search on

841
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,960
google but how come

842
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,039
facebook will pop up this particular ad

843
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,159
right so

844
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,760
somewhere someone was collecting

845
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,320
information then they aggregate

846
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,519
all information from all different apps

847
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,640
maybe through the browser or somewhere

848
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,200
then they aggregate and they target

849
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,919
myself

850
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,159
so if you just look at one application

851
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,399
you may say oh i'm very safe

852
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,519
no problem virtually about everything

853
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,000
but when i collaborate with some other

854
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,039
applications

855
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,399
then maybe our pi will be identified

856
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,799
so there are many horrible switch

857
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,960
scenarios you probably can

858
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,000
find on the internet if a person really

859
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,480
want to target you find who you are

860
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,840
uh it's not impossible so

861
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,960
so a basic practice is as following

862
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,840
uh like i say if you have a consumer's

863
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,640
data right

864
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,720
you want to say i want to separate the

865
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
data into two relation

866
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,159
relational database tables and in one

867
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:10,879
table

868
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:14,159
i can store his or her name and the

869
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,560
personal

870
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,280
information or personal identifiable

871
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,480
information

872
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,760
and then have a hash id then using this

873
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,960
hid

874
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,399
i can join another table the key will be

875
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,480
hash id unique hid

876
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,719
or you want to say maybe the hid may not

877
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,800
mean to be unique so that's another way

878
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,079
to make sure

879
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,800
the data you cannot target one person

880
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,159
maybe just a google person

881
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,199
then hash id has

882
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,960
then indexed to non-pii information

883
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,440
so the table this second table can be

884
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,480
accessed by

885
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,480
a data processor if they look at the

886
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,560
table they look at hash id

887
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,879
they look at all these numpy information

888
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:57,839
they are fine

889
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,920
they are not able to be able to identify

890
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,960
who is doing what

891
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,400
right only data controller oh

892
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,880
he or she can join two tables to know oh

893
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,880
this person with this hash id

894
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,000
is edward so edward has accessed

895
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,520
facebook and google in the last few days

896
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,640
so this is a very primitive way

897
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,839
of trying to be compliant but

898
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,640
for sure it's not really in fully

899
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,200
compliance

900
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,119
so the second method is differential

901
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,520
differential of privacy this was

902
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,040
proposed by

903
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,720
professors in hong kong ust

904
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,680
the idea was i don't really need to

905
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,560
separate

906
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,920
your pi from your uh his

907
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,720
access history but i just need to

908
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,359
introduce

909
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:52,160
noise to the data right in this example

910
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,359
here

911
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,839
on the top you see you have a very

912
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,680
specific information about person

913
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,440
including office in london department id

914
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,599
date joint 2015 and cell information

915
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,720
and so on so forth right if you get a

916
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,760
hold of

917
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,720
this this piece of information uh in the

918
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,359
company

919
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,599
if you work in the company you see this

920
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:16,720
it's probably not

921
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,880
not very challenging to infer who is

922
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,160
this person

923
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,599
so you say okay i'm going to try to

924
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,920
introduce noise so rather than london i

925
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,520
say well uk

926
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,200
and uh they joined i wouldn't want to

927
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,320
specify the the month just a year

928
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,680
then the day of birth i specify

929
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,240
and then maybe just a decade or an half

930
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,839
hour time

931
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,359
but still this is not booty proof so but

932
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,000
in theory differential privacy is

933
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,720
attractive

934
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,560
because they can come up with a

935
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,480
quantifiable method

936
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,599
to save guardian privacy and you can see

937
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:56,320
the formula

938
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,720
is in the middle of the screen the idea

939
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,920
here there are two

940
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,280
uh parameters one is this uh uh

941
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,440
sigma parameter so they have this sigma

942
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,040
algebra the sigma edgewise

943
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,119
i'm going to introduce you introduce to

944
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,960
your data certain noise

945
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,320
right so for particular field we already

946
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:14,800
seen

947
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,000
you say well i'm going to apply this

948
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,359
h expansion or

949
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,560
birthday kind of anonymize your year but

950
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,200
we put your day and month over there

951
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:27,920
this kind of

952
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,040
algebra and then they have these privacy

953
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,000
parameters

954
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,680
right they say well it's just like a

955
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,680
newest neighbor search so last time we

956
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,200
covered news neighbor but we didn't

957
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:37,760
finish

958
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,079
we continued next time was when you do a

959
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,520
newsletter search

960
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,160
you don't get just yourself you get a

961
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,119
group of people

962
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,359
so then you say i cannot really pin you

963
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,800
down as

964
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,880
a particular person in that group so

965
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,800
this is this appstore means

966
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,760
you can introduce this epson and then

967
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,040
there's a trade-off here

968
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,200
for the company to decide you see the

969
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,119
left-hand side the trade-off is

970
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,480
oh private private privacy magic

971
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,599
so you want to safeguarding privacy then

972
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,400
the epson value need to be very small

973
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:10,800
but

974
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,880
if you say well i don't quite care about

975
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,320
your policy i care about

976
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,880
uh utility sorry is it the other way you

977
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,640
want to safeguarding privacy

978
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,520
absolute value need to be large so when

979
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,800
you want to

980
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,200
when the information is given you you

981
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,200
identify actually a lot of people not

982
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:27,839
just

983
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,079
a small number of people so it's hard to

984
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,520
pin down one individual

985
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,079
and by the same nice utility metric so

986
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,320
if i get a whole bunch of people here

987
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,880
then this application suppose i want to

988
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,520
do

989
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,960
uh do a search i want to do information

990
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,839
dissemination recommendation then my

991
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:46,960
accuracy

992
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,000
right the applications target

993
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,920
performance metrics will suffer and for

994
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,880
any company which needs to generate

995
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,680
revenue

996
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,640
the revenue for sure will go down so the

997
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,040
question here is very very simple

998
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,200
uh privacy it's possible to be

999
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,160
implemented right so you say my privacy

1000
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,839
regulation is very loose

1001
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:16,160
and comply with privacy eventually

1002
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,960
can be kind of enhanced but i'm going to

1003
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,640
lose a lot of revenue

1004
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,119
will the company do that or would they

1005
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,800
try to do any kind of

1006
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,320
circumvention to prevent compliance

1007
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,520
so this is a real problem and

1008
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,599
that's the reason again probability

1009
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:34,960
becomes important

1010
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,720
so let's come back to look at this

1011
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,480
differential privacy

1012
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,000
and depends on how large the epstein you

1013
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,240
won't want it to be the privacy can be a

1014
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,440
local privacy

1015
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,560
or a global privacy local privacy means

1016
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,040
okay i have a small group of people i

1017
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,320
just want to

1018
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,000
implement this uh sigma algebra

1019
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,160
so magically alter their private data

1020
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,400
then i have an aggregator and eventually

1021
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,200
i can

1022
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,200
store the data but i can make my

1023
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,480
privacy slightly more global means

1024
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,760
i have an aggregator i already aggregate

1025
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,960
information from a large number of users

1026
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,160
let's say female or male then i use a

1027
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,599
magic formula

1028
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,880
to alter them right so then i have this

1029
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,920
anonymous output and because the

1030
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,319
input is a group of people so it's much

1031
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,079
harder to track back to

1032
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:35,200
individuals so when you combine both

1033
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,960
right suppose i say well your private

1034
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,400
data

1035
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,920
individual data i'm going to do a

1036
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,680
shuffling and then

1037
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,400
i do another layer i analyze the

1038
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,760
shuffling results

1039
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,800
and applying even more magic then i

1040
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,960
really anonymize everyone

1041
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,440
so the question is let's say the the

1042
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,640
final master

1043
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,920
is probably the most secure one but

1044
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,000
it probably provides uh the the business

1045
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,599
usage information to make their profit

1046
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,480
right so again this is a big trade-off

1047
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,000
situation

1048
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,200
so people trying to do this differential

1049
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,359
privacy then i think it's kind of

1050
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,000
dying out now it's really hard to prove

1051
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,640
to

1052
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,760
an auditor saying this is my epsilon

1053
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,280
this is my sigma

1054
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,880
so this is this is the way i conduct the

1055
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,599
business

1056
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,319
and i prove in theory this will work but

1057
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:33,520
no you cannot prove

1058
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,760
everything is done empirically and the

1059
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,440
even you show the empirical data

1060
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,920
and who can trust you in pure data so

1061
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,560
harvard

1062
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,960
published this uh interesting article

1063
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,560
it's interesting but

1064
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,359
it was not very sung basically uh this

1065
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:48,160
paper saying

1066
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,440
well you you do your differentiate uh

1067
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,640
differential or pseudo

1068
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,319
anonymization on the data but we can

1069
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:01,920
re-engineering we identify the users

1070
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,880
right so

1071
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,240
the experience they did was they get

1072
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,760
about 300 users data from the

1073
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,960
the medical databases then they say well

1074
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,520
everyone was anonymized so let's start

1075
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,400
to add

1076
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,960
additional information let's say a zip

1077
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,520
code

1078
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,800
and date of birth and so on and so forth

1079
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,200
at the end they say well we can identify

1080
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,079
accurately

1081
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:29,440
about 90 of people so

1082
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,440
i really i mean i understand this is a

1083
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,560
kind of uh interesting result

1084
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,800
showing the more personal data you know

1085
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,920
about a person

1086
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,000
you can more accurately infer who the

1087
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,960
person is

1088
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,680
but this is no brander right so the the

1089
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,880
chance to me was

1090
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,119
if you only have 300 pieces of

1091
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,960
information then you clam you can

1092
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,240
identify person 95 accurately

1093
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,319
i think it's an easy problem but if you

1094
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:57,680
enlarge your pool

1095
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,040
from 300 to 3 million and i bet

1096
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,800
even with a zip code you cannot do that

1097
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,640
and if you have day of birth here

1098
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,960
frankly

1099
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,200
uh even even with one million people the

1100
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,000
accuracy can

1101
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,280
still be quite high right so i

1102
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,480
respect the paper but the paper

1103
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,680
itself didn't really tell me

1104
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,319
any promising or exciting methods

1105
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:29,240
so federated learning it started from

1106
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,800
2017

1107
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,200
google uh wrote a paper and also a blog

1108
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,680
introduced the method the method is very

1109
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,800
logical

1110
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,839
so we all have our devices

1111
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:44,880
our laptop or cell phone

1112
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,000
and whatever personal devices and we

1113
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,960
don't

1114
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,079
send our private data to the app so

1115
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,040
to the concluded cloud so all data

1116
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,000
mining

1117
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,839
all this kind of machine learning will

1118
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,119
be conducted

1119
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,800
on the phone right so after

1120
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,520
the machine learning has been conducted

1121
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,520
the model has been learned

1122
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,960
on the phone then the model will be sent

1123
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,079
to the cloud and the cloud

1124
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,640
or is the centralized system then we'll

1125
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,720
aggregate all the information

1126
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,839
and develop a global model and the

1127
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,359
global model will come back

1128
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:26,160
in return compared to this target

1129
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,040
individual cell phones

1130
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,599
so on the one hand this is kind of

1131
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:32,720
attractive

1132
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,359
on the other hand it also introduces

1133
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:36,240
arrows

1134
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,440
to the classification and not only

1135
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,960
introduces arrows

1136
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,960
but there could be other problems let's

1137
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,880
say what kind of information you

1138
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,760
aggregate

1139
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,040
suppose i own the android system

1140
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,079
and or ios

1141
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,400
so the amount of data i collect is not

1142
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,240
just from one application i actually

1143
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,200
call that data from

1144
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,319
all different applications so

1145
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:03,440
as i as an example i gave you a few

1146
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,240
minutes ago

1147
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,960
this is even more dangerous than getting

1148
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,000
all information

1149
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,079
from one applications right one

1150
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:11,200
particular application

1151
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,520
but you get all information get

1152
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,960
information from all

1153
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,560
applications then you do uh

1154
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,280
kind of color collaborating among them

1155
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:21,760
and

1156
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,280
the kind of information you can call is

1157
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,440
just totally horrible

1158
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,599
and okay let's look at healthcare as one

1159
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,839
example suppose i have a

1160
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:33,680
deep neural net and this feature shows

1161
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,680
there are multiple layers attention

1162
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,839
layers and so on so forth

1163
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:40,560
and the idea of this federated learning

1164
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:40,960
is

1165
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,640
i'm going to cut off this multi-layer

1166
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,880
neural networks into two parts

1167
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,520
right so my animation doesn't work but

1168
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,319
actually

1169
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,480
the key thing is in the middle here

1170
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,839
let's say i draw a line

1171
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,240
in the middle here okay okay actually

1172
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,599
this picture will show

1173
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,640
so i have four hospitals each has

1174
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,839
been training the model based on their

1175
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:06,319
let's say

1176
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:09,680
x-ray data they want to do this cd scan

1177
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:13,680
or maybe lung disease classification

1178
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,680
so each hospital have collected certain

1179
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,920
data then run their own

1180
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,800
training algorithms and then i say okay

1181
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,520
i'm going to

1182
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,280
cut your neural net into a half

1183
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,920
so the top half so you learn in the

1184
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,440
middle then i say stop

1185
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,920
don't continue learning just ship me all

1186
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,760
the model parameters

1187
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,000
then you say okay i'm going to continue

1188
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,359
learning here

1189
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,839
in my center database so you guys stop

1190
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,440
learning i'm going to aggregate

1191
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,920
right so at the bottom here you show

1192
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,800
this is a

1193
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,839
send central centralized continuous

1194
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:48,560
learning

1195
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,480
and getting parameters from all

1196
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,240
different sites

1197
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,839
and this method seems to be

1198
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:59,119
reasonable but but there are clearly

1199
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,599
uh two shortcomings from medical

1200
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:02,960
perspective

1201
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,520
the first shortcoming is as angeline

1202
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,560
said

1203
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,319
every hospital may collect data

1204
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:12,400
using different process different

1205
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,359
devices

1206
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,079
or even same device same device with

1207
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,920
different process or

1208
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,960
calibrations so when you

1209
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,000
aggregate the parameters in

1210
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,520
this subsequent model those parameters

1211
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,920
may not agree with each other and that

1212
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,040
could problematic because

1213
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,640
each other will become your noisy

1214
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,119
disturbance rather than trying to help

1215
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,160
you

1216
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,520
so for the test data that could be

1217
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,280
this method could be productive because

1218
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,280
text it attached is the text

1219
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,720
but for imagery this pipeline may not be

1220
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,800
able to improve your accuracy

1221
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,520
and and in practice i see these kind of

1222
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,480
methods

1223
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,359
um it's really hard to be realized

1224
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:00,640
because

1225
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,839
no hospital here would trust

1226
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,720
other hospitals every hospital consider

1227
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,400
their own data to be

1228
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,480
to be a piece of gold they don't want to

1229
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,160
share with others

1230
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:16,480
so only perhaps in on android phone or

1231
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,520
on ios

1232
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,880
this federated learning can be conducted

1233
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,400
but for health care i have really strong

1234
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,040
doubt

1235
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,800
okay so problem solved

1236
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,079
and i don't think so and the

1237
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,200
two key problems one or the

1238
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,319
enumerate which is the trade-off between

1239
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:41,280
privacy safeguarding and the utility to

1240
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,280
the company or revenue of the company

1241
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,000
right this is always an ethical problem

1242
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:46,880
and

1243
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,640
a company a ipo post ipo company they

1244
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,960
have obligation to their shareholders

1245
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,119
and the ceo is under tremendous pressure

1246
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:56,400
to perform

1247
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,680
so i don't know where the ceo would

1248
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,920
draw the boundary then the second

1249
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,119
challenge is

1250
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,680
probability right you can claim anything

1251
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,400
but

1252
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,160
ccpa now requires a company to prove

1253
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,559
so this again this is the picture to

1254
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:13,440
summarize

1255
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,240
regulations but at the end on the right

1256
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,040
hand side

1257
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,079
is you should be able to trust

1258
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:23,200
the company and the company has to be

1259
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,160
able to prove

1260
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,839
their results and the policies so let me

1261
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,240
spend the remaining time to introduce

1262
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,200
saltaria sotaria is the goddess of

1263
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,000
greece

1264
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,880
it's kind of providing individuals

1265
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,400
safety

1266
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,720
and the basic idea is we want to lock

1267
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,839
everything including user consent

1268
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:49,119
user revocation and

1269
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,920
so all the consumers actions on their

1270
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,720
data

1271
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,040
and all these actions conducted by the

1272
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,400
company basically

1273
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,559
need to be hardened on a ledger

1274
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:03,040
and this ledger if you want to be able

1275
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,040
to be people to trust the ledger

1276
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,880
this ad ledger need to be open

1277
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,800
transparent to the public

1278
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,319
so anyone can audit the ledger if i say

1279
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:15,200
no no no this is a centralized system

1280
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,000
this is

1281
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,800
the bank's ledger so you can i'm going

1282
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,319
to log everything but

1283
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,880
sorry i cannot allow you to come in to

1284
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:23,680
see

1285
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,920
the details because i don't want you to

1286
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,160
see other people's account balance

1287
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,599
then this is a ledger which is not

1288
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:32,640
transparent

1289
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,839
and cannot bring people's trust okay so

1290
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:37,040
transparency

1291
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,400
is the key so that leads to uh

1292
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,119
the centralized and versus decentralized

1293
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:44,079
system

1294
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,960
the centralized system by the names

1295
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:47,760
basically saying

1296
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,960
all the data all the synchronization is

1297
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,079
conducted

1298
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:55,440
by one unit right let's say a central

1299
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,319
bank

1300
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:59,680
or all the banks in the u.s uh they have

1301
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,240
this

1302
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,440
uh bank the headquarter bank

1303
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,359
and all information need to be

1304
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:06,559
synchronized with

1305
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:08,960
the headquarters so when a bank want to

1306
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,000
close their books

1307
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,960
every day they have to synchronize uh

1308
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,640
from the center to all the

1309
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,400
distributed uh bank bank branches

1310
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,040
to try to reconcile their their books

1311
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,640
and decentralized means

1312
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,960
all individuals can communicate with

1313
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,079
each other

1314
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,440
and you can do local decisions

1315
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,160
but eventually uh we need to be able to

1316
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,440
reach global agreement

1317
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:37,839
okay so we come back to see an example

1318
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:41,119
is this centralized banking system uh

1319
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:44,000
deposit withdrawal and so on so forth

1320
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,240
let's say i have two atms

1321
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,280
i'm using two atms from one atm i

1322
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,680
deposit money the other atm i will show

1323
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,640
money right

1324
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,880
so the important thing is you need to be

1325
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,559
consistent you cannot say

1326
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:59,359
well before my deposit goes in i already

1327
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,720
withdraw my money

1328
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,440
so i have this kind of i kind of double

1329
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,640
deposit whatever

1330
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,400
this kind of secret scenario and you

1331
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,079
know in the bitcoin situation they want

1332
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:09,200
to save money

1333
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,599
double spending right you say i want to

1334
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,000
use my bitcoin to buy ten dollars of

1335
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,119
uh goods in in one company or one

1336
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:19,119
store use the same bitcoin to buy

1337
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:20,880
another thing so there's a

1338
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,000
window about 30 minutes

1339
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,839
for a bitcoin transaction to be

1340
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:28,640
committed we think that 30 seconds

1341
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,160
a person can double spend and that

1342
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,079
problem has to be closed right

1343
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:34,720
so but bitcoin is a decentralized

1344
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,760
problem it's much

1345
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,960
more challenging in a centralized

1346
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,040
problem but central apartment bank

1347
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,520
is one example and another example can

1348
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,559
be hospital

1349
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,880
so you say okay i'm going to perform

1350
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,880
certain process on a patient

1351
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,240
the information will be stored in the

1352
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,319
hospital but eventually the information

1353
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:50,880
has to

1354
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,040
be sent to who sent to a payer right

1355
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,480
sent to insurance company

1356
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,160
so insurance company pays the bills and

1357
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,720
they pretty much aggregate all the data

1358
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,359
together

1359
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:05,119
they have all hospitals data and this is

1360
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:07,440
pretty much universal in canada they

1361
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,319
have a

1362
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:09,839
universal health care run by the

1363
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,839
government the government has to pay the

1364
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:12,400
bills

1365
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,240
so the government has all the health

1366
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,839
care records of the canadian citizens

1367
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:19,520
now again the question is trust if you

1368
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,599
have a centralized system

1369
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:23,599
how can i trust you because you are not

1370
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:24,880
going to reveal me

1371
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,880
all the actions you have conducted so

1372
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,000
we like to be able to have a

1373
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,400
decentralized system so decentralized

1374
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,480
system the question then will be

1375
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,480
you have certain inconsistency that will

1376
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,079
happen you have

1377
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:41,119
local agreement but globally

1378
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:44,480
may not be agreeable so therefore

1379
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,599
consensus protocols need to be executed

1380
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,760
so consensus protocol can be separated

1381
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,359
into two camps

1382
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:54,480
one is distributed consensus you could

1383
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,800
have local consensus eventually you

1384
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,359
uh convert to global consensus or you

1385
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:00,079
just have a

1386
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:02,640
centralized consensus protocol and

1387
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,200
centralized

1388
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,520
consensus protocol has been out there

1389
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,040
for many many years

1390
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,359
because bank banks or airline

1391
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:10,720
reservation systems

1392
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,800
have been out there for more than two

1393
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,720
decades right

1394
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,760
for allies airline reservation systems

1395
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,040
and when they started about even 20-30

1396
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,319
years ago

1397
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:26,240
even today they haven't be able to

1398
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,839
really changing the system because it's

1399
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,280
just too many agents

1400
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,599
try to access the database and any

1401
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:33,359
modification to the system

1402
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:38,559
around into the risk of data corruption

1403
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:41,040
so we don't get into all these protocols

1404
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,960
in in details because we want to

1405
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,160
stay in a on a high level and the server

1406
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,000
has courses to cover

1407
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,720
uh the detail methods and when i was

1408
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,359
back in

1409
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:53,520
the cs department 20 years ago there was

1410
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,720
a database course

1411
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,720
then there was a transaction processing

1412
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,480
course and the transaction partnering

1413
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,839
costs will cover

1414
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:03,040
all these protocols to safeguarding

1415
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,920
agreement so let me just give you an

1416
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,000
example this is a rudimental

1417
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,319
consensus protocol talk or two-phase

1418
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:11,839
commit protocol

1419
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:15,119
so i have my participants

1420
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:17,599
right and eventually i need to make a

1421
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:18,640
decision

1422
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:22,799
so let's say i want to have a consensus

1423
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:25,200
we in a class you say when are we going

1424
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:25,920
to do

1425
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,160
our is hypothesis hypothetically when

1426
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,040
are we going to do

1427
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,799
our final exam and then i send send out

1428
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:35,280
two dates one is next tuesday another

1429
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,559
one next thursday

1430
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:40,319
then students start to vote right so

1431
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:42,079
once i get all the votes i say okay

1432
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,079
majority people vote for

1433
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:46,640
thursday so i would say i will return

1434
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:47,760
back to you to say

1435
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,240
okay now i'm prepared to come come meet

1436
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,599
because our rule is

1437
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:55,040
majority wings and then the decision in

1438
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,160
the decision phase

1439
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,880
the student will say yeah i was i was

1440
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,359
saying tuesday i prefer but now

1441
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:04,240
the kind of a majority decision is

1442
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,160
thursday so i'm going to okay

1443
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,400
commit i'm going to decide to commit so

1444
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,119
you have second phase of communication

1445
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:13,280
so in the two-phase company protocol

1446
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,480
here you see

1447
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,839
the overhead is the number of messages

1448
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:19,359
going back and forth

1449
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:22,640
to reach consensus and if the number of

1450
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,839
participants

1451
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:26,240
is small and you have this kind of

1452
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,839
centralized system

1453
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:31,119
and the cost is linear to the number of

1454
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:32,000
participants

1455
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,880
right say i have 10 students and maybe

1456
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,160
the message will be

1457
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,400
sending back and forth 40 times because

1458
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,079
the two-way messages for

1459
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:42,960
each face but then when you say i want

1460
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,240
to do a

1461
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,760
global but decentralized kind of company

1462
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:48,799
protocol

1463
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:51,280
then the cost will be much much higher

1464
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,640
will be n square

1465
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,640
right so everyone has to be able to talk

1466
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,839
to everyone in the most general

1467
00:56:56,839 --> 00:56:58,319
situation and this

1468
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:00,880
is not affordable now you say well on

1469
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,280
the one hand i want to be transparent

1470
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,760
i want each person to be able to make

1471
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:06,319
their

1472
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:09,440
kind of own decision they can look at

1473
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,440
other people's data but on the other

1474
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,240
hand i have this kind of enormous cost

1475
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,799
how can i mitigate or i do the

1476
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,000
reasonable trade-off

1477
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,400
and the trade-off easy to understand

1478
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,119
here is

1479
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:22,880
i'm not going to talk to it to everyone

1480
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,319
although i want to do decentralized

1481
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:25,119
system

1482
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:27,359
but i'm going to talk talk to just a

1483
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:28,400
group of people

1484
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,960
right a group of people who i can trust

1485
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,000
they say

1486
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,760
i when i want to make a commit decision

1487
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,599
or when i say i want to sell my medical

1488
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:43,520
data record to sahil and

1489
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:47,359
this agreement only need to be approved

1490
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:50,400
or been seen by let's say triple a

1491
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,520
bank of america and maybe tesla only

1492
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,000
three

1493
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,359
because why i don't think they together

1494
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:59,839
have any interest to con conspire

1495
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:00,480
together

1496
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,960
to kind of hear me right so i say okay

1497
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,079
that's good enough

1498
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:06,559
three participants to vote for years

1499
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:08,720
then i can move on and

1500
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,839
so this is a kind of compromise

1501
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,400
but also reasonable right but if you say

1502
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,960
i'm going to randomly select

1503
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,160
a few then the situation will be much

1504
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,520
more dicey

1505
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,839
so just slightly talk about the bitcoin

1506
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:24,799
situation

1507
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:27,359
bitcoin is entirely decentralized and

1508
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:27,920
they say

1509
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,280
oh if two-thirds of people

1510
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,920
are voting saying your transaction is

1511
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,480
hard

1512
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,839
it's just an example or

1513
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:40,000
when they start to build new blocks

1514
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,040
right so

1515
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,079
when the new boss has been granted

1516
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:46,160
has been committed they have this that

1517
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,839
kind of longest block

1518
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:50,079
will win now this condition so you have

1519
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:51,280
a block which is

1520
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,559
six blocks longer you have a check which

1521
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:55,200
is six

1522
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,839
longer than the other chain then all the

1523
00:58:57,839 --> 00:58:59,119
previous blocks

1524
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,160
will be hardened or will be granted or

1525
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,040
be committed

1526
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,319
but this would take some time right and

1527
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:09,200
they don't actually identify who are the

1528
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,079
people

1529
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:13,280
who can make a block committed so

1530
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,119
it's like racing you have to solve a

1531
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:16,480
puzzle and

1532
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,480
when a large number of people solve a

1533
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,160
puzzle then the block

1534
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:23,280
is kind of hardened and so who can solve

1535
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,880
the possible is random

1536
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,040
and they say even you say two-thirds or

1537
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:27,920
one-half

1538
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,760
the people in this two-third and one not

1539
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,760
one-half one-half tool

1540
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,119
they are random you don't know whether

1541
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:35,040
they can be trusted or not trusted

1542
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,960
so eventually you know uh some powerful

1543
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,599
uh kind of resource company they

1544
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:43,119
actually can hack down

1545
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:45,359
a bitcoin because they can own the

1546
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:47,680
majority of gpu in the world

1547
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,559
and they can be the majority of this

1548
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:51,040
kind of

1549
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:54,079
voting scenario right so instead of

1550
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:55,280
doing that kind of

1551
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,400
so expensive computation

1552
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,079
why not just saying oh i'm not going to

1553
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:02,000
send to 1 billion people

1554
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,079
i'm going to get these 10 people right

1555
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:05,440
uh these 10 people have

1556
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,440
config of interest with each other if

1557
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,280
they so or say yes

1558
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,359
then that's fine with me so that's

1559
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:12,640
pretty much the idea be

1560
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,839
between a centralized decentralized and

1561
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:18,160
decentralized you have this n square

1562
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:21,359
messaging cost and x maxing cost is huge

1563
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:22,240
because you know

1564
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,119
i o is much more expensive than cpu or

1565
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:26,960
gpu time computational time

1566
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,000
so that would just grind your system to

1567
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,440
a halt

1568
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,520
again the trade-off will be okay i'm not

1569
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,200
going to talk to n

1570
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,400
i'm going to talk uh just a small subset

1571
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,720
of n so this decentralized

1572
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:46,079
uh picture shows the trade-off between

1573
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:46,960
cost

1574
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:50,160
and the trust between transparency again

1575
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,400
and the trust and there are so many

1576
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,920
different protocols recently got

1577
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,040
proposed

1578
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,040
to be able to achieve a very good

1579
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,960
compromise between the two

1580
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,839
so what do i say good compromise really

1581
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:02,799
depends on

1582
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:05,599
the applications objective okay i can

1583
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:06,160
again

1584
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,200
give you a couple examples shortly so

1585
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,240
consensus versus transparency

1586
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,880
in the privacy situation uh all the

1587
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,079
actions like

1588
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:19,280
what can the data allow the consumer

1589
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,480
to be uh processed by the by the by the

1590
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,280
business

1591
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,880
and the contract open up our information

1592
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,760
rectification all the information need

1593
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,680
to be transparent to the public

1594
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:36,079
so can be audited and using blockchain

1595
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:38,960
to solve the problem first of all let's

1596
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,319
quickly identify

1597
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:42,799
the structural blockchain so a chain of

1598
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:43,520
blocks

1599
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,559
let's say h is the height

1600
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:50,319
means i have h individual blocks

1601
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:53,440
and every block may consist of

1602
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,079
a number of transactions right in the

1603
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:57,920
transaction is in the sense of bank is

1604
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,599
straightforward deposit

1605
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:02,720
and maybe withdraw or i look at my

1606
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,000
account history

1607
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,200
in the case of privacy every transaction

1608
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:07,839
is like

1609
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:10,559
oh user account a user is consent user

1610
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:11,039
b's

1611
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:14,480
revocation and business a

1612
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,039
access user b's data right those are the

1613
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:18,000
transactions

1614
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,720
upon your data subject will all be

1615
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:21,359
locked

1616
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:25,599
on the blockchain so this is one example

1617
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:28,960
or in one single block of the chain

1618
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,920
and the transactions are organized into

1619
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:32,240
a

1620
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:35,359
merkle tree so the characteristic of

1621
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:36,640
merkel trees

1622
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:40,079
if you change one of the leaf

1623
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:42,880
and then the hash value in the merkle

1624
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:43,280
tree

1625
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:46,319
will be modified so why we call this

1626
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:47,599
indelible because

1627
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:50,400
no one can come here to hack your data

1628
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,680
if someone did

1629
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,280
then the hashing value will be

1630
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,280
mismatched and

1631
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,319
we can identify and then this is like a

1632
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:00,000
binary tree eventually going up to the

1633
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,720
top

1634
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,760
and we have this root hash

1635
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,359
which is usually utilized to

1636
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:06,799
authenticate this

1637
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:10,000
block is not contaminated then

1638
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,079
this block has a hash index

1639
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:17,760
to the previous hash block so when we

1640
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,720
in in the index altogether you can see

1641
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,559
the blockchain has a number of

1642
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:25,119
blocks they are linked together with

1643
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:26,160
this kind of

1644
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:30,160
previous uh previous head address and

1645
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:33,599
every block has a number of transactions

1646
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:36,400
organized in this merkle tree now it's

1647
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,559
very evident why you only have a pointer

1648
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:40,000
to the previous block

1649
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,599
because you have no idea when you

1650
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:44,160
establish a plot you have no idea when

1651
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,200
the next ball will be

1652
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,319
will be established

1653
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,599
so key requirements here i'm not going

1654
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:52,400
to repeat

1655
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,480
transparency and the privacy and

1656
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:55,599
probability

1657
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:58,559
so now let's let's just step back to see

1658
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:00,000
how the blockchain

1659
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,960
can be utilized efficiently because i

1660
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,799
talk about bitcoin and you know bitcoin

1661
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,000
very well

1662
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,880
it's the problem is it's latency right

1663
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,839
latency of bitcoin means

1664
01:04:10,839 --> 01:04:14,000
i need to trust a transaction

1665
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,280
but i need to wait for about half an

1666
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:18,000
hour

1667
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,920
because unless the transaction

1668
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,079
the the block which the transaction

1669
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:25,039
resides

1670
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:28,480
get committed and in addition

1671
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:31,119
that particular block resides in a

1672
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:32,000
blockchain

1673
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,280
which has a length six more blocks than

1674
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,359
the second longest one then i would say

1675
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:39,039
okay my transaction

1676
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:41,599
has been hardened and this will take

1677
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:42,720
half an hour

1678
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,880
and this is a pretty long time if you

1679
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,440
want to do this half an hour transaction

1680
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:50,000
then payment is impossible you do

1681
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,119
payment you go to

1682
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:53,280
stock box you say i'm going to use use

1683
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,960
blockchain to pay my bill

1684
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,079
the commit time is uh six hours so i

1685
01:04:58,079 --> 01:04:59,680
think starbucks wouldn't accept your

1686
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:00,319
payment

1687
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:03,359
so like privacy or like

1688
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:06,480
uh currency if you want to use this kind

1689
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:07,200
of

1690
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,319
bitcoin methodologies something has to

1691
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:11,200
change

1692
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,079
and this is the way we did it so before

1693
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:15,920
we get into detail let's look at this

1694
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:16,960
eric brewer's

1695
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,400
cap theorem cap cap c stands for

1696
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,599
consistency

1697
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:24,799
so data viewed by different parties

1698
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:27,520
need to be consistent in the same order

1699
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,760
right you say i withdraw then i

1700
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,319
i deposit other people look at the

1701
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:33,760
record they want to see

1702
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,359
we saw deposit they want to see the

1703
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:36,319
other way then you have this

1704
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:37,680
inconsistent problem

1705
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,000
availability is another one you want the

1706
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,359
system to be up

1707
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:43,520
all the time so this is like the cell

1708
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,720
phone networks

1709
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:46,880
so if my if i shut down my cell phone

1710
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:49,119
now it shouldn't affect your

1711
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:52,400
your cell phone right it's very easy to

1712
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,079
understand because you want your cell

1713
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:55,440
phone to be available

1714
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,440
not depending on other people's cell

1715
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,400
phones and the partition tolerance

1716
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,559
and in the banking system partition

1717
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:04,400
tolerance is not allowed

1718
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:07,520
but in our cell phone scenario general

1719
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,720
network scenario

1720
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,440
internet partition tolerance should be

1721
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:12,160
allowed

1722
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,960
otherwise if my laptop is done your

1723
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,000
laptop needs to be

1724
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,799
in a standby mode that's not acceptable

1725
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:19,520
so

1726
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:22,160
if we look at this picture then we say

1727
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:22,640
well

1728
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,480
in the internet era if we want to do a

1729
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,079
distribute system

1730
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:28,799
this is one property we cannot sacrifice

1731
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:30,240
right which is partition

1732
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,359
tolerant okay we have to safeguarding

1733
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:34,160
this

1734
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:38,559
uh partition torrent property which is p

1735
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:40,480
but now since every poor theory is

1736
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,480
saying you can only

1737
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,799
ensure two out of three properties can

1738
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:46,319
be guaranteed

1739
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:49,359
at a simultaneous at one one time so

1740
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:50,720
either you choose

1741
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:54,559
uh cp or you choose

1742
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:57,839
ca a pa pa or

1743
01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:02,000
only two other three or ca the the banks

1744
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,960
choose ca right they don't care about

1745
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,240
partition tolerance

1746
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,640
if there's a partition they shut down

1747
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,920
the system right away

1748
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:12,880
they guarantee consistency and when the

1749
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,319
system is consistent

1750
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:17,520
they open up they they make sure it's a

1751
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:18,400
scalable

1752
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:22,400
available so decentralized system as i

1753
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,520
just summarized

1754
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,559
we need to provide people just either cp

1755
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:29,760
or ap for the sake of bitcoin

1756
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:33,599
they provide this a and amp

1757
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:35,760
because bitcoin want to be available all

1758
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:36,720
the time

1759
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:39,680
and they want to also allow a network to

1760
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:40,799
be partitioned

1761
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:44,079
but they sacrifice consistency as i

1762
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:45,200
again just mentioned

1763
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:48,559
we think about six hours or half an hour

1764
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:50,880
depending on the situation your

1765
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:51,920
transaction

1766
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:54,559
was in an inconsistent state so double

1767
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:55,520
spending

1768
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:59,280
could happen and uh

1769
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:02,799
summarize bitcoins problem one is very

1770
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:04,160
expensive to maintain

1771
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,720
such a blockchain and one billion

1772
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:07,440
dollars

1773
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,640
a year and the lack of privacy why

1774
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:13,520
because you put data on the chat so now

1775
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,119
you say edward are you kidding

1776
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:16,799
you want to put medical data on the

1777
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:19,679
chain so you want to put medical data in

1778
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:20,799
the public

1779
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:22,560
so i will come back to address the issue

1780
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,560
shortly and

1781
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,640
use a pos proof of work protocol

1782
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,279
means you want to solve a parcel and

1783
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:32,080
nuance

1784
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:35,198
it's very expensive and finally low

1785
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:35,839
throughput

1786
01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:38,319
right transaction per second for bitcoin

1787
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:40,319
is only seven transactions per second

1788
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:44,560
and ethereum is 15. not much better

1789
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,799
so we if we utilize that to be a payment

1790
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:47,839
that's impossible

1791
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:50,719
and if we want to utilize for security

1792
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:52,560
privacy preservation

1793
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:55,120
that's kind of also not very convenient

1794
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:55,600
but

1795
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,158
we can solve the problem so banking i

1796
01:08:58,158 --> 01:08:59,520
talked about the centralized system

1797
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,198
using ca

1798
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:03,120
and we also already discussed the

1799
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,479
trade-off between

1800
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:07,120
centralized and decentralized consensus

1801
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,319
protocols

1802
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:11,120
and then let's look at satellite how can

1803
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:11,600
you

1804
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,158
implement a system which is at the same

1805
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:14,799
time

1806
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:18,000
can ensure this uh ap ap

1807
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,120
kind of property also can insure

1808
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:24,158
uh pc my pc and pa

1809
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:26,479
at the same time so pc and pa if you

1810
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:27,839
union a tube

1811
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:31,279
you can become pca the trick here is

1812
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:33,120
we want to be able to achieve short

1813
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,319
latency like

1814
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:36,719
one to two minutes and the super need to

1815
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:38,238
be extremely high

1816
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:40,719
and we are arguing this is actually

1817
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:41,439
argued by

1818
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:44,880
professor uh measures professor measures

1819
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,319
by the way

1820
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:49,359
he was one of the founders of uh uh

1821
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:52,479
stellar a standard or the ipo

1822
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:55,520
uh is maybe number eight the

1823
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,440
public published company probably ibo

1824
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,760
company on blockchains

1825
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,040
and uh he he and us had

1826
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,880
many many interesting debates so

1827
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,320
basically i say okay

1828
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,800
let's have this two-layer ball chain so

1829
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,080
you have men chen

1830
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:13,040
insures ap properties in the worst case

1831
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:13,679
main change

1832
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:16,880
ethereum it's in the public domain but

1833
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,600
the side chain will be on the ca using

1834
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,719
ca property

1835
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:23,840
right we are using uh cp property

1836
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,880
is also okay so the side chain will be

1837
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,920
very very quick but the mention will be

1838
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,600
be very slow

1839
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:34,719
so this is the picture or sidechain

1840
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:36,640
let's say even using cs system

1841
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,280
the mention is using this this uh ap

1842
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:40,080
system

1843
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:43,040
we organize them into three layers the

1844
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:44,560
first layer is a public chain

1845
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,000
with very slow response time

1846
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,199
and high latency and the second layer

1847
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:53,760
with very fast execution time low

1848
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:54,560
latency

1849
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:57,199
and high support the method to improve

1850
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:58,320
super is like

1851
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,480
david measure said you just replicate

1852
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,480
your cpu right you just improve

1853
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:05,120
just duplicate your local system and i

1854
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,320
only care about

1855
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,880
latency you want to guarantee latency

1856
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,800
then when you want to guarantee super

1857
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,560
if you have sufficient business you just

1858
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,159
replicate your system

1859
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:16,400
so that's a claim by professor david

1860
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,560
measures and we have to agree with him

1861
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,320
and finally you have this smart contract

1862
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,480
which is the way to

1863
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,880
not to put data on the blockchain but

1864
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,000
you put contract

1865
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,040
on the blockchain even more beautifully

1866
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:32,480
the contract is in nature language

1867
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:35,760
so if you say i put uh something

1868
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,199
on the blockchain which is my private

1869
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:39,040
data is is really bad

1870
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,600
if i put a digital contract which is a

1871
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,719
piece of code

1872
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:45,440
on the blockchain in fact we will be

1873
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,520
eventually put a piece of code

1874
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,600
on the blockchain let's say i want to

1875
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,440
access your data

1876
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,360
and this is a agreement in nature

1877
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,040
language but

1878
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,520
we need to be able to convert this

1879
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,199
nature language statement

1880
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:02,560
to a piece of restful api or sql

1881
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,840
statement let's say

1882
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:07,120
fetch something from

1883
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:10,560
relational database k with attribute

1884
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:11,280
equal to what

1885
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:14,159
right so with this particular piece of

1886
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:14,800
code

1887
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,920
but already approved then certain people

1888
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:18,480
can

1889
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:21,360
just execute the code to get your data

1890
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,640
so smart contract

1891
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:25,600
is a very important piece of information

1892
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:26,560
sitting here

1893
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,800
for two reasons one through nature

1894
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:29,600
language

1895
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,080
user can understand what they are up to

1896
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,520
then we convert

1897
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,159
the piece of information into a piece of

1898
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:36,800
code

1899
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:39,120
and this conversion i pretty much

1900
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:39,920
covered

1901
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,400
when i talked about oval right we had a

1902
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,040
lecture about this

1903
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:48,159
human voice speech interface

1904
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:51,120
and in that i talked about in oval and

1905
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,040
we need to do semantic grounding

1906
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:55,360
simulink grounding in principle is very

1907
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:56,239
challenging

1908
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:58,400
but if you want to just go on into

1909
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,280
programs

1910
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:02,239
it's much easier because programs only

1911
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:02,800
have

1912
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,199
a small number of instructions and also

1913
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:06,480
they are not ambiguous

1914
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,880
right in nature language a word can mean

1915
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:11,199
multiple meanings you have polygamy or

1916
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:14,320
other situations but in code when you

1917
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:14,640
say

1918
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,880
right it's right when you say move it's

1919
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,400
smooth so

1920
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:21,600
smart contract is the good solution

1921
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,239
so smart contract summarizes it it's a

1922
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:25,840
piece of nature language

1923
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,880
construct to convert to a code and the

1924
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,159
data is offline

1925
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:33,040
retrieved by approved code and the

1926
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:34,159
contract validation

1927
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:36,159
relocation execution will generate

1928
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:38,320
transactions and these transactions

1929
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:41,120
will be written onto the blockchain so

1930
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:42,960
when you look at a blockchain you you do

1931
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:43,840
see oh

1932
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,840
i have a piece of code executed but the

1933
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,360
code number

1934
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:50,880
is 722 you have this id and

1935
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,520
then you have transactions to form a

1936
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:54,320
tree

1937
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:58,080
and the root of the merkle tree

1938
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,560
on the subchain right we say sub channel

1939
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,760
will be very efficient

1940
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:04,159
but you say okay i make the subject very

1941
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:05,280
efficient

1942
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:08,880
but the root of the markov merkle tree

1943
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:12,480
i lock it to the main chain so when i

1944
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:15,040
lock the secondary route to the main

1945
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:15,760
chain

1946
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,560
the process will suffer from low latency

1947
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:18,960
but

1948
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,719
it's okay right because i can

1949
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:25,920
locally guarantee the transaction has

1950
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,199
been hardened

1951
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:30,239
but probability can be done

1952
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:32,800
can be guaranteed maybe half an hour

1953
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:33,920
later

1954
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:36,960
so this is acceptable acceptable to the

1955
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,480
private situation because even i want to

1956
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:38,880
sue

1957
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,000
a company i cannot fire a lawsuit within

1958
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,280
uh within half an hour right so

1959
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,920
i do have half an hour probably if you

1960
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:48,320
want to

1961
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,000
contact a lawyer to find a lawsuit that

1962
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,520
would probably take a few days

1963
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,800
so this hierarchical architecture

1964
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,040
is just beautiful you can accomplish the

1965
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:58,159
objectives

1966
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:01,199
to summarize we have this uh

1967
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:04,880
on a sidechain we have cash blocks

1968
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,520
and they got they got linked together

1969
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,040
and they enjoy the performance of

1970
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,480
high throughput because you get

1971
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:13,199
replicated systems and more importantly

1972
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:15,760
low latency and the privacy is

1973
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:18,000
safeguarded because we don't store data

1974
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:18,960
on the blockchain

1975
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:22,719
we only store the id of the code

1976
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:24,320
on the blockchain data is in the

1977
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,560
database access through

1978
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:30,080
the code and then we hash the root

1979
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:34,239
of the local merkle tree to the global

1980
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:38,320
blockchain so when the public auditing

1981
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,880
when the public audit is conducted they

1982
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:41,920
can go back to the

1983
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:45,920
global uh global blockchain to verify

1984
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:49,120
the local mercury hash value is not

1985
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:49,920
altered

1986
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:53,120
right this ensure often

1987
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:56,320
authenticality so

1988
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,480
this picture just to complete when we

1989
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:59,520
implement system

1990
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,760
we still need to have a reasonable user

1991
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:02,880
interface

1992
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,960
if you like to know the details you can

1993
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,239
look into our

1994
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:09,440
publication available on the internet

1995
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:12,960
let me get into slightly more details

1996
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,400
on the left-hand side right you have

1997
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,320
interface here

1998
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:19,600
both data consumer data provider can

1999
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,560
access through the web and the data

2000
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,080
provider let's say i'm a

2001
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,880
patient i can say okay i have a data my

2002
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:27,440
x-ray

2003
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:30,320
i'm willing to sell my data at the price

2004
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,679
and data consumer

2005
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:32,960
comes in to say this may be a

2006
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,880
pharmaceutical company saying i like to

2007
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,000
be able to beat

2008
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,560
uh 20 pieces of data in a particular

2009
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:39,360
situation

2010
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:42,080
or i say i want to do irb i want to do

2011
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,040
kind of

2012
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:46,159
draw discovery or or vaccine tests i

2013
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:47,120
need to recall

2014
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:49,840
10 10 million people or 10 000 people i

2015
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,199
can go to the system and say

2016
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:54,719
who willing to give me your vaccine

2017
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:57,600
drug interaction or side effect data so

2018
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,080
then this agreement can be conducted

2019
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:02,719
through the web application so once the

2020
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:04,080
the consensus have been

2021
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:06,480
performed then the data will be stored

2022
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:07,120
right

2023
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:09,920
into the database at the same time the

2024
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:10,719
blockchain

2025
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:13,280
will be also locked on the blockchain

2026
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,280
and then when the audit comes in

2027
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:18,000
is the bottom is audit audit comes in

2028
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,400
you can look into the local database

2029
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:21,920
which caches the blockchain's

2030
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,920
information and right away i can say

2031
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:24,480
well

2032
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,159
uh the company already fulfill your

2033
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:27,840
requirement and this is the information

2034
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,120
i can give you right away

2035
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,760
the response time for this ats cache can

2036
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,199
be just within seconds

2037
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:35,280
then they say no i don't trust you i

2038
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,280
want to go to the core to verify

2039
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,280
then the core will not access the

2040
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,280
company's private data here storing the

2041
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:42,000
cache

2042
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,880
the core will go to zotero which is a

2043
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,400
transparent public

2044
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:49,280
ledger and the court or auditor can go

2045
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:50,000
there

2046
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,960
to access the all the transaction

2047
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,360
transactional information

2048
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:58,159
and this is a picture thanks to

2049
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:00,239
professor david measures

2050
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:03,679
monica and the shivaya in ntu and we try

2051
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:04,400
many different

2052
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:07,280
local protocols and eventually we

2053
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,960
identify stellar

2054
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:12,320
and tender mean those are two

2055
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:16,560
good protocols we can employ and uh

2056
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,800
there's a very strong argument from

2057
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,320
professor david measures

2058
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:23,520
he's a no-nonsense guy he said why do

2059
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:24,640
you guys want to use

2060
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,719
blockchain because i can see this entire

2061
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:29,520
system can be implemented by a log only

2062
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:32,159
method it's just log right you just

2063
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:32,960
logging

2064
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:37,360
why do you need to ensure consistency

2065
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:40,239
in this whole thing this is not payment

2066
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:40,560
and

2067
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,800
we do have a very good counter argument

2068
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,880
that counter argument

2069
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:48,480
ceased his concern so if you have time

2070
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,000
to think about it

2071
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,760
why we need to have consensus

2072
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:56,239
on consistency on the order of

2073
01:18:56,239 --> 01:18:57,280
transaction

2074
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:01,040
in the privacy preservation scenario

2075
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:03,280
yeah it's an interesting question to

2076
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,040
think about

2077
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,679
uh so we uh do some experiment we

2078
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:09,679
conducted but the details

2079
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:12,719
uh again referred to our publications

2080
