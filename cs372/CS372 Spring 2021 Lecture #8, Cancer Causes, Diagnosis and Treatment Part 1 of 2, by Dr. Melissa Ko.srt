1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,080
so welcome to

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,320
cs 372 and today we

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,440
are very glad to be able to invite uh

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,359
professor melissa gao to come back to

5
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,000
give us a lecture on cancer

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,680
biology again uh i met melissa about two

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,320
years ago

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,880
i took her course it stands for

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,240
continuous

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,200
study session and then last year we

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,280
invited melissa to give us

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,000
two lectures and i learned a lot from

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,040
from her

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,000
and she graduated from mit in major in

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,440
biology

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,120
then finish her cancer biology phd

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,760
program

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,879
at stanford and she's right now a fellow

19
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:51,360
of

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,239
science and engineering education so

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,520
melissa please

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,800
just take over thank you so much yeah

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,239
thank you for having me again

24
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,480
uh welcome everyone good morning hope

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,239
you're doing well

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,159
uh yeah so this is the first of a

27
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,080
two-part little series that i'll be

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,880
doing um

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,040
this thursday and then also next

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,760
thursday just really thinking about

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,159
cancer i will give an introduction to a

32
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,920
lot of aspects of cancer that are

33
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,840
important so if you don't have a lot of

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,640
biology

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,119
background i'll try to provide the

36
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,200
context that you need

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,520
but we will look at sort of the front

38
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,079
end of cancer which is how it's caused

39
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,240
how it's diagnosed and then next

40
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,320
thursday we'll focus a lot more on

41
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,400
how do we then treat it based on all

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,640
this stuff that we've learned from it

43
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,360
so the agenda for today is i do want to

44
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,880
give you sort of the background that

45
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,040
you'll need so thinking about how cancer

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,600
is caused we'll talk about things like

47
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,720
carcinogens and mutagens um we'll talk

48
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,159
about the genetics of

49
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,439
cancer so thinking about how

50
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,719
mutations in genes contribute to cancer

51
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,360
which is

52
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,680
how it contributes to cells acting

53
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,520
really abnormally

54
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,520
and becoming what we think of as

55
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,280
cancerous and all those sort of

56
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,000
traits associated with cancer cells so

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,878
we'll connect

58
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,440
the genes themselves to what cancer

59
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,000
actually

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,640
does and how it acts um and then we'll

61
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,879
start getting into like with all of that

62
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,720
sort of foundation we'll start getting

63
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,120
into the more data-driven side so we'll

64
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,879
talk about the different ways that we

65
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,560
characterize cancer

66
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,599
through data and thinking about how we

67
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,160
diagnose cancer and how those two relate

68
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,000
so how do we use

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,440
lots of different big data and big data

70
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,080
methods

71
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,640
to maybe diagnose cancer better either

72
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,840
more accurately

73
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,519
um earlier or as we'll get to

74
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,680
next week like diagnose it with an eye

75
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,319
towards treating it better so that's

76
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,319
really the goal for today and then as i

77
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,319
said next week we'll focus much more on

78
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,319
the treatment piece

79
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,840
and also next week there's a lot of sort

80
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,080
of open-endedness for people who have

81
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,879
questions or they just want to ask about

82
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,400
connecting you know if you're

83
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,959
more from a cs engineering side like how

84
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,480
do you connect to

85
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,599
careers that relate to this kind of work

86
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,280
um so just a little bit about me um

87
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,040
thanks for the introduction so

88
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,640
i'm sharing a little bit more about

89
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,640
myself so i'm a local

90
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,720
i grew up in the california bay area i

91
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,560
did go away for college but i came back

92
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,200
for grad school and i've been here since

93
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,799
as mentioned i'm a science and

94
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,480
engineering education fellow in the

95
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,319
bioengineering department

96
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,159
and what that really just means is that

97
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,640
i work on

98
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,120
education for that specific department

99
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,040
so i focus a lot on

100
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,920
um what is the goal of a bioengineering

101
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,680
education what do we want our undergrads

102
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,000
to actually get out of doing a four-year

103
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,599
degree program but my background was

104
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,519
very traditional sort of cancer biology

105
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,040
um i did major in biology like i work in

106
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,959
education a lot now but my background

107
00:03:58,959 --> 00:03:59,760
was all

108
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,360
first wet lab biology and then

109
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,280
computational biology

110
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,360
and so what my own research was about

111
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,319
was trying to

112
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,439
use methods like visualizations to

113
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,480
understand

114
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,040
why some cancer cells would die with

115
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,599
treatment but others would resist

116
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,519
and so these bottom pictures here are

117
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,279
sort of hinting at that i did

118
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,839
a lot of graph visualizations to try to

119
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,759
figure out what was so special about

120
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,160
these resistant cells

121
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,400
and i just want to say um i am very

122
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,199
happy as

123
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,000
always to talk to students at stanford

124
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,120
um that's why my

125
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,880
the joys of my work is getting to

126
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,800
interact with students so if you want to

127
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,479
chat at any time or connect

128
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,160
just feel free to email me i've put my

129
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,600
email here and i'm sure that it's

130
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,080
probably

131
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,000
listed somewhere or because your stamper

132
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,680
you could look me up and

133
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,680
shoot me an email so i'm very welcome to

134
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,120
that

135
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,759
all right let's get started so let's

136
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,639
talk a bit about cancer

137
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,720
so if you're not familiar with sort of

138
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,800
the the

139
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,600
the story around cancer which i think is

140
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,320
a very

141
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,479
dominant thing in the us and it tends to

142
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,840
be the dominant thing

143
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,520
or it used to be the dominant thing in

144
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,680
countries where um

145
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,080
for example infectious diseases or

146
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,880
diseases

147
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,840
of childhood are less of a thing like in

148
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,440
what we would consider

149
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,160
the developed world that's where cancer

150
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,600
tends to emerge as then

151
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,120
the thing that preoccupies society

152
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,720
and that's largely because cancer is

153
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,720
associated with people getting older

154
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,560
so in general in countries where they

155
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,039
don't worry as much about diseases that

156
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:33,600
affect

157
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,840
youth and where people have longer life

158
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,960
expectancies

159
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,120
that's in turn where you tend to see

160
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,880
more and more cancer

161
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,880
and at some point you start to feel like

162
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,720
you know lots of people who have

163
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,400
at some point fought cancer at some

164
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,400
point died from cancer

165
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,560
and so currently i think the statistics

166
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,520
are something like

167
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,720
one in two or one in three americans

168
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,680
in their life span will get cancer so

169
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,840
it's very it's a very large number

170
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,600
and as you can see it's age associated

171
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,280
so something is happening as we get

172
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,160
older

173
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,960
um it's true that there are some young

174
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,840
people who get

175
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,880
cancer like children even um but by and

176
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,120
large we're looking towards like

177
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,240
middle age and sort of into 50s 60s

178
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,720
70s is where you get cancer and then it

179
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,800
kind of falls off i would say probably

180
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,880
in large part because those folks

181
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,880
are less likely to get diagnosed with

182
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,720
cancer and even if they're diagnosed

183
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,600
it's they're sort of all these other uh

184
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:29,919
i

185
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,919
believe comorbidities like other

186
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,360
conditions that they're dealing with so

187
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,800
it kind of falls off because they're

188
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,639
less likely to catch the cancer and

189
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,720
actually be trying to fight the cancer

190
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,319
as opposed to dealing with other health

191
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,199
issues so let's talk a bit about

192
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,720
what's happening as we age and so

193
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,720
first off as we age you're sort of

194
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,160
accumulating

195
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,000
your life experiences so you can think

196
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,560
of it as you're accumulating exposure to

197
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,080
stuff so as we live and navigate the

198
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,240
world we're going to be exposed to

199
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,840
carcinogens um i know the joke in

200
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,840
california is that we have the little

201
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,759
proposition signs that say warning

202
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,120
something in this building will cause

203
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,000
cancer

204
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,360
um that's that then some sense may

205
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,800
seem overblown but it's kind of just

206
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,160
like a byproduct

207
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,520
of living in the world where there's a

208
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,759
lot of pollutants or there's a lot of

209
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,599
chemicals that maybe we haven't even

210
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,800
identified yet

211
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,440
that might have some role in promoting

212
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,400
cancer

213
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,240
um and you just kind of run into them

214
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,919
over the course of your lifetime and

215
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:32,639
it's sort of just

216
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,520
incidental that here and there you might

217
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,720
run into a chemical

218
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,840
that then causes a mutation um

219
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,199
so i just want to give an example

220
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,120
actually this isn't even a chemical this

221
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,759
is

222
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,240
uv radiation so if you just get a lot of

223
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,440
sun exposure

224
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,680
to the extent that maybe you're getting

225
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,879
sunburned

226
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,000
um that is evidence of you know

227
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,840
being exposed to something that has the

228
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,039
potential

229
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,919
to cause a mutation and so what i'm

230
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,120
showing you in this picture

231
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,120
is just this idea that some of these

232
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,160
chemicals

233
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,400
and the way they interact with your body

234
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,560
might be then interacting with

235
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,199
dna in some of your cells right so if

236
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,960
you're getting uva radiation from a

237
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,520
sunburn

238
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,400
chances are um the radiation is acting

239
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,199
with this

240
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,080
cells on your skin and so it could be

241
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,840
causing mutation in your skin

242
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,639
cells and so what's happening generally

243
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,280
speaking

244
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,400
in a lot of adults as they get older and

245
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:28,720
they

246
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,879
navigate through life they take a plane

247
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,200
trip maybe they smoke depending on their

248
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,279
lifestyle choices

249
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,200
they go to the beach is that they're

250
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,000
accumulating mutations over time

251
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,360
and it's the case that we'll talk about

252
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,519
that it's not just one or two mutations

253
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,680
it's kind of a kaleidoscope

254
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,560
of mutations kind of all coming together

255
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,480
and that's really what leads to cancer

256
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,279
so

257
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,000
as we age it's kind of like accumulating

258
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,680
these little genetic

259
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,240
tweaks and hits and if we get enough of

260
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,720
them

261
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,760
in the right constellation then cancer

262
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,080
arises and that becomes just more likely

263
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,080
as you get older

264
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,720
so let's talk a bit about mutation so

265
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,480
we're exposed to these things exposed to

266
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,240
the sun exposed to these chemicals

267
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,440
our dna changes so what so we're going

268
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,519
to connect that dna change to

269
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,839
what we actually get out with cancer

270
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,760
so if you're not super familiar with

271
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,560
why dna matters um you can think of it

272
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:26,880
as

273
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,720
dna basically is the recipe book it is

274
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,040
the instructions to make

275
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,040
almost anything that matters in the cell

276
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,880
in terms of you know the recipe to make

277
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,440
things like

278
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,560
proteins or things like rna and the

279
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,200
protein

280
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,480
rna is the material that does something

281
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,000
right so when the cells are sort of

282
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,279
sitting there and it just has

283
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,640
all of its dna if the cell needs to send

284
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,800
signals if the cell needs to grow

285
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,839
in certain shapes or directions or if it

286
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,680
needs to divide

287
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,080
all of those things would happen like

288
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,800
that that

289
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,440
action would manifest as a result of the

290
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,720
dna

291
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,240
providing the instructions to make

292
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,839
proteins um

293
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,600
so we call this the central dogma which

294
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,839
is the idea that you have your dna

295
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,920
but that is used to make rna which is

296
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,079
then made used to make protein and the

297
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:16,800
protein

298
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,200
does something right so pretty much

299
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,959
anything you can think of

300
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,200
chances are a protein has been made to

301
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,480
help facilitate

302
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,720
that ability right so it could be

303
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,160
something structural or could be

304
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,040
something like

305
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,240
behavioral all of those come about

306
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,560
through

307
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,399
gene expression which is what we call

308
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,160
this pathway

309
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,000
and so the reason why mutations matter

310
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,079
is because they change the recipe

311
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,920
right so i'll just give you an example

312
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,000
here there's just a way that we know to

313
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,399
read the code of what the mrna says

314
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,959
in terms of these letters and that sort

315
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,680
of has

316
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,880
a an output like an expected output in

317
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,279
terms of the recipe for the protein

318
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,680
and when we have a mutation it changes

319
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,720
the recipe

320
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,160
and so it could be the case that it's

321
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,240
just a very small change like basically

322
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,440
switching out an ingredient

323
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,399
a ingredient you could think of it as

324
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,480
you're baking cookies instead of using

325
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,640
brown sugar use white sugar but it could

326
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,880
be something really catastrophic so the

327
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,880
way i told people is that maybe there's

328
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,680
just a slight

329
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,839
mutation but it's kind of the same as if

330
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,800
you were reading a recipe for cookies

331
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,399
and then the pages got stuck together so

332
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,680
you flip to the next page and then you

333
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,839
start making croissants instead

334
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,839
so there's this real potential to sort

335
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,360
of have these genes that are just

336
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,240
completely

337
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,120
disrupted like the recipe is almost um

338
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,600
nonsensical after a certain point

339
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,760
and as a result that protein is just

340
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,519
different the way it functions could be

341
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,720
very different

342
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,320
it's possible to have mutations that

343
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,560
don't change the function of your

344
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,240
proteins but there's lots of mutations

345
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,079
that could make the protein

346
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,120
not work or work better which sounds a

347
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,480
little strange but we'll talk about what

348
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,880
that means when it like is

349
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,560
overactive all of those depending on

350
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,279
what the gene

351
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,200
actually normally does could be a

352
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,120
problem

353
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,720
um are there any questions up until this

354
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,279
point i have my chat open and i have all

355
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,399
of people's

356
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,000
pictures up so if at any point you have

357
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,680
a question you can hit the raise hand

358
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,279
button or you could put the

359
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,040
question in chat because i'll see it

360
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,519
either way

361
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,200
um and i did just want to highlight

362
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,279
there are bigger mutations so the one i

363
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,720
showed you on the previous slide was

364
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,160
kind of like a

365
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,760
you know in that sequence that we're

366
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,760
familiar with in terms of um

367
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,920
like the dna we represented as like a

368
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,240
series of letters like atcg

369
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,000
i was showing you small changes before

370
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,600
where it was just like oh just change a

371
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,160
letter

372
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,880
or add in a letter or delete a letter

373
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,240
but what we do see

374
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,519
it you know occurring by accident um

375
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,399
in our dna is bigger changes where

376
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,279
there's sort of like a

377
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,959
swath of dna that gets changed in some

378
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,000
way

379
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,519
so what could happen is you could have

380
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,839
sort of an entire piece of your dna get

381
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,200
copy pasted

382
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,600
it can get flipped around it can get

383
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,720
deleted

384
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,360
um it can move from one chromosome to

385
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,480
another

386
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,160
all of these are possible um changes

387
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,800
i just want to show you here what that

388
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,959
kind of looks like this is a karyotype

389
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:11,920
which is when we

390
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,360
take the dna in a cell we stain each of

391
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,040
the chromosomes so that they

392
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,600
they can be kind of easily identified

393
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,079
and then we

394
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,720
lay them out in size order and normally

395
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,240
people are supposed to have two of each

396
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:24,639
one

397
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,639
and the two they have should look fairly

398
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,560
identical at this level

399
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,079
um and what you can see is that there's

400
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,240
examples here where there's chromosomes

401
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,120
missing

402
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,480
there's chromosomes that kind of look

403
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,160
like they're a mishmash of two

404
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,279
chromosomes because they have two

405
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,480
different colors

406
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,920
these are the types of things we might

407
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,600
see in cancer where we just lose

408
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,839
chromosomes gain pieces of chromosomes

409
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,279
or chromosomes kind of get

410
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,639
pieced together we see this in cancer

411
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,000
and in fact there are some

412
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,199
famous examples of basically two

413
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,320
chromosomes sort of

414
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,680
swapping dna and that results

415
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,160
at that interface where the swap happens

416
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,160
in this sort of franken gene

417
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,240
that's like parts of two genes so that

418
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,079
example i gave a part cookie park

419
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,440
croissant

420
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,279
there's an example in cancer especially

421
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,040
childhood cancer where there's a franken

422
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,320
gene that's part

423
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,240
one protein and part another protein and

424
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,639
actually drives a majority of a specific

425
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,079
type of childhood cancer

426
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,040
just from that weird happenstance

427
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,720
occurrence where these two genes come

428
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,079
together which is not typical

429
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,760
so these are all the kinds of mutations

430
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,600
we might expect to see but why do they

431
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,040
matter

432
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,720
so if you're not familiar with how we

433
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,079
talk about

434
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,720
genes in the context of cancer when

435
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,480
we're usually looking at a mutation

436
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,320
and we're like okay you know say that a

437
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,680
gene was deleted

438
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,440
when we're looking at that gene and how

439
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,120
it relates to cancer we're

440
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,199
thinking about things like oh is it kind

441
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,600
of neutral like it didn't have any role

442
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,560
in the development of the cancer or does

443
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,680
it have a role and is the role that

444
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,399
when that gene was lost that enabled

445
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,079
cancer to happen because the cancer that

446
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:00,880
was previously

447
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,680
held back lost the thing that was kind

448
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,600
of constraining it

449
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,360
or is it a mutation where maybe

450
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,760
something became overactive

451
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,320
and that overactivity actually allowed

452
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,760
cancer to be

453
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,360
to be able to do the thing that it wants

454
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,680
to do so we kind of think of it as

455
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,000
is it a gain of function or is it a loss

456
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,720
of function

457
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,680
in a gene that's relevant to cancer and

458
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,399
so if it's a

459
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,880
loss of function in a gene if that's

460
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,079
relevant to the cancer

461
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,240
that gene might be what we call a tumor

462
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,759
suppressor gene

463
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,560
so it's a gene whose normal function

464
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,000
generally keeps

465
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,560
things like cancer at bay it usually

466
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,160
holds things back

467
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,920
and so when you lose it it's kind of

468
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,399
akin to losing the brakes

469
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,240
in your car so the car just kind of

470
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,480
doesn't know how to stop anymore

471
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,639
versus gain a function happens in what

472
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,399
we call an oncogene

473
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,720
and so these oncogenes are genes that

474
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,800
normally do something that cancer likes

475
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,360
and so cancer instead you know it likes

476
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,040
that activity and then it takes it to

477
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,680
11.

478
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,680
so it gains function it becomes let's

479
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,920
say uncontrollable

480
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,160
and we think that that as analogous to

481
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,519
when you're hitting the gas

482
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,199
but it's just jammed like it just

483
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,519
continuously is encouraging the car to

484
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,800
accelerate

485
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,600
so those are kind of our um paradigm for

486
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,639
thinking about

487
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,959
genes and their relevance to cancer is

488
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,120
the gene more like a tumor suppressor

489
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,399
gene or is it more like

490
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,720
an oncogene when we see it being mutated

491
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,720
in cancer

492
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,880
so i just want to give an example of how

493
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,399
we get these breaks

494
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,440
versus how we get these gas pedals

495
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,399
so an oncogene i want to be very clear

496
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:40,720
is

497
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,120
not a new piece of dna a new piece of

498
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,240
gene that came from nowhere there's

499
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,160
actually a really interesting story

500
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,240
in the history of cancer where we used

501
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,000
to think that maybe

502
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,399
cancers happen to us because of

503
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,000
something external

504
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,600
um so the way you could think of it is

505
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,279
that we used to kind of think like oh

506
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,279
there's like a virus or a bacteria or

507
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,079
something

508
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,359
that gets into us and makes us ourselves

509
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,119
start acting abnormally

510
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,720
but one of the really cool stories with

511
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,799
what we realized was that

512
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,280
there are examples of cancers being

513
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,640
caused by viruses

514
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,160
but what's actually happening is when

515
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,760
that virus infects us

516
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,439
it actually is either giving us dna that

517
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,359
is that came from us originally

518
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,520
just it's a mutant version of our own

519
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,720
dna

520
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,520
or it's being it's it does change our

521
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,160
dna but just to make our own dna

522
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,760
more active for example and so we do

523
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,200
have these genes that do

524
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,520
promote things that cancer likes right

525
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,440
like we have our own cells that need to

526
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,320
grow

527
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,320
our own cells that need to divide right

528
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,600
like that's how we

529
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,679
develop from a fertilized egg into a

530
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,200
person is that our cells grow and they

531
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,160
divide

532
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,080
so we already have that blueprint within

533
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,760
us to do those types of things

534
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,400
it's more a matter of um in the case of

535
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,039
cancer

536
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,520
you take that gene and then you turn it

537
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,360
on when it's not supposed to be on or it

538
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,000
becomes

539
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,799
way more overactive right so just

540
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:07,760
showing you here

541
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,679
it could be a slight tweak in the recipe

542
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,200
so then it's just

543
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,960
super active right like it's just way

544
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,200
more potent than it was supposed to be

545
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,840
or maybe you have just a lot more of it

546
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,520
right and so in the case of

547
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,799
um uh cancers caused by viruses

548
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,160
it was actually something that looked

549
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,799
like this where it was basically we

550
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,200
had that dna already it was just that

551
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,039
the virus sort of came in

552
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,360
and either gave us an extra copy or gave

553
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,520
us a mutant copy or gave us

554
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,679
sort of this hyperactivity it gave us

555
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,919
this way that our own genes got dialed

556
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,039
up to 11

557
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,640
so that our cells would start acting

558
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,799
cancerous so it's just this kind of neat

559
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,320
story in the history of cancer where we

560
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,760
thought these viruses were giving us

561
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,280
something completely

562
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,679
foreign to our cells and we actually

563
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:52,400
discovered

564
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,080
that what they were giving us was our

565
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,080
own dna or activating our

566
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,720
own dna and that it came from us

567
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,440
originally

568
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,720
all right so that's oncogenes again this

569
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,520
is something that

570
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,000
gains functionality it's something that

571
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,960
cancer cells

572
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,320
like and they just dial it up and the

573
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,320
reverse is the tumor suppressor gene

574
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,520
so as you can imagine um the way

575
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,840
that our genes sort of operate in

576
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,640
totality

577
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,799
is like a circuit right so we have

578
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,240
certain things that we will do

579
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,640
especially switching on in response to

580
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,559
something about our environment

581
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,640
but it usually has these like uh

582
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,480
feedback loops or self-regulation

583
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,480
mechanisms right so often something will

584
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,600
switch on

585
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,919
and then that as a result of sort of the

586
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:38,960
cascade of

587
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,559
genes and how they interact with each

588
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,400
other it then switches itself

589
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
off again right so there's a way in

590
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,480
which a lot of how our genes have

591
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,360
evolved is

592
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,520
this circuit where things will switch on

593
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,120
and then switch themselves off just to

594
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,559
prevent sort of

595
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,240
um you know a runaway process

596
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,080
um and so we have these things called

597
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,600
tumor suppressor genes that are just

598
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,039
inherent in our dna um we like to

599
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,799
have cells divide but we want to do it

600
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,640
in a controlled manner right we want our

601
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,159
cells to divide but we want them to just

602
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:08,559
then

603
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,120
stop and wait for the q to then divide

604
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,080
again

605
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,760
and so these tumor suppressor genes just

606
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,200
normally exist in

607
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,559
our body and the idea is that when

608
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,240
you have a mutation in the case of

609
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,600
cancer that protein gets deleted

610
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,280
or it just doesn't function there's

611
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,880
something about it the recipe that

612
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,559
changed and it just doesn't do its job

613
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,480
properly anymore and so it's just not

614
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,679
holding that process back and so one of

615
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:34,480
the main

616
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,919
uh uh examples of this that you may have

617
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:38,480
heard of

618
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,520
is a protein called p53 and so

619
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,080
p53 has gotten this nickname as the

620
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,200
guardian angel

621
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,600
of the cell and one of the reasons for

622
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,559
that is it's just such a

623
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:52,480
all-encompassing sorry tumor suppressor

624
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,200
gene

625
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,400
it's very sensitive to all of these

626
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,120
different

627
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,280
things that the cell is facing so if the

628
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,520
cell doesn't have enough nutrients if

629
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,159
the cell

630
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,320
is in a low oxygen environment if the

631
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,679
cell experience

632
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,799
dna damage or let's say that it's in the

633
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,880
middle of replicating if something went

634
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,600
wrong

635
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,640
p53 responds to that it senses that

636
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,320
and what it does is it mediates all

637
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,720
these things that cancer doesn't like

638
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,400
all of these things do not serve a

639
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,240
cancer cell well so it either would

640
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,919
cause the cell to die

641
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,480
it caused the cell to stop dividing it

642
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,840
caused the cell to enter a state where

643
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,520
it never divides again

644
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,960
all of these things are sort of the

645
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,559
antithesis of

646
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,960
what cancer cells do and so that's why

647
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,880
p53 has sort of this central

648
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,919
role in cancer and in fact mutations

649
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,240
where we lose p53 and it doesn't work

650
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:42,799
anymore

651
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,760
are found in like 50 of cancers like

652
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,600
cancers are very diverse in terms of

653
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,360
what ends up getting mutated

654
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,640
it's not like there's one gene

655
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,320
responsible for a hundred percent of

656
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,200
cancers

657
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,960
but the closest we come to that is

658
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,240
something like p53 p53 is lost in

659
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,080
most cancers all right are there any

660
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,679
questions up until this point

661
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,480
questions

662
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,440
so we talked about these different types

663
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,520
of mutations and i just want to be very

664
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,159
clear

665
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,559
that cancer is actually as i said before

666
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,000
the accumulation of

667
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,559
lots of these mutations so it's not the

668
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,600
case that you just get

669
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,559
one mutation oncogene and then suddenly

670
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:27,520
you would see the

671
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,799
full-blown pathology of like stage three

672
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,600
lung cancer you usually need several

673
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,400
mutations in a collection of oncogenes

674
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,080
and tumor suppressor genes

675
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,280
all together in the same cell for it to

676
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,000
then start

677
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,760
acting like a cancer cell and start

678
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,919
developing into a tumor

679
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,600
um and so the way you can think of it is

680
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,120
this is sort of a timeline from

681
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,480
left to right where it's like oh

682
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,880
starting from when we are a single cell

683
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,400
and then we start developing and at that

684
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
point we become a multi-cellular

685
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,760
individual we just accumulate mutations

686
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,080
and some of that actually is not even

687
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,919
related to carcinogens

688
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,600
it's just a feature of every time our

689
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,320
cells divide they need to copy literally

690
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,400
billions of letters and they just make

691
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,360
mistakes right

692
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,880
it's kind of like if overnight you had

693
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,120
to stay up and copy a three billion

694
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,159
letter or character novel and just type

695
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,360
it up by hand

696
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,360
you'll make a mistake here and there and

697
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,280
that's what happens in our own cells is

698
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,080
that they just make

699
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,880
random mistakes as they're dividing and

700
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,440
so we're accumulating those mutations

701
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,200
and then we start accumulating mutations

702
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,039
associated with our environment and our

703
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,360
lifestyles that could be radiation

704
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,320
pollution certain chemicals and those

705
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,400
start to accumulate and at some point

706
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,159
you might start to see then

707
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,200
the onset of cancer so if enough of

708
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,600
those

709
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,400
random mutations occur together in a

710
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,520
single cell

711
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,000
that cell then might start you know

712
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,360
let's say dividing

713
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,679
more than it's supposed to and every

714
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:58,799
time it divides

715
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,480
it's kind of like it's rolling the dice

716
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,480
to see oh will i mutate again

717
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,400
and it's just by chance if it mutates

718
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,559
again that could kind of keep it uh

719
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,440
snowballing towards being a cancer cell

720
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,559
and so that's what we see here

721
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,799
closer to the right is that you start

722
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,799
having like this like early tumor and

723
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:15,360
early

724
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,120
growth that's just more than it's

725
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,720
supposed to but at some point

726
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,600
as it keeps growing and growing it could

727
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,480
take on

728
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,600
new abilities to be closer to cancer

729
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,840
which is not just about growth it's

730
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,039
about being

731
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,480
invasive and really disrupting not only

732
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,840
that part of the body but also

733
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,679
migrating to other parts of the body as

734
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,600
well so that's what you see here more on

735
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,159
the far

736
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,720
right um so yeah i want to just be very

737
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,799
clear it's a multi-step process

738
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,840
it's again just by chance are you

739
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,760
getting all of these mutations

740
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,240
um all together in a single cell that

741
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,880
lead to this cancerous ability

742
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,720
there's some lifestyle sources that do

743
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,159
accelerate this

744
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,320
but again it also is completely random

745
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,840
as well

746
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,080
so when we're looking at what these

747
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,159
mutations are perturbing

748
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,120
so we're mutating some genes those genes

749
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,080
normally had a

750
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,240
job within the cell and that job is

751
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,159
being changed either that protein

752
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,159
doesn't function anymore or that protein

753
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,400
functions way too well

754
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,400
all of that contributes all those

755
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,440
different mutations

756
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,240
to the traits that we associate with

757
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:24,799
cancer

758
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,559
um and so if you see haven't seen this

759
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,080
diagram before it's it's

760
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,159
sort of like a seminal diagram in the

761
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,080
field of cancer biology

762
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,559
we call this the cancer hallmarks these

763
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,919
are like the defining

764
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,600
feature of cancer and so some of these

765
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,720
are a little more

766
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,880
obvious of things like the fact that

767
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,919
these cells just

768
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,320
keep on growing keep on dividing i think

769
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:46,960
that's just

770
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,279
what most people associate with cancer

771
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,120
but there's other things that um

772
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,799
are associated with cancer as well so

773
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,720
the fact that for example

774
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,240
um as the tumor starts growing um

775
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,320
it becomes this big mass of cells and

776
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,559
it's a very hungry mass of cells and at

777
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,600
some point

778
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,000
normally cells are being fed by the

779
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
blood vessels nearby those blood vessels

780
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,480
bring

781
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,880
oxygen and food but when you have this

782
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,000
giant growing mess

783
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,679
of cells like a developing tumor

784
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,279
they get super hungry and there's not

785
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,960
enough food and so they actually

786
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,279
develop a way to recruit additional

787
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,039
blood vessels to sort of bring them

788
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,880
all the food that they need and so

789
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,480
that's an example of a trait that you

790
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,919
might not associate with cancer but it

791
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,720
is actually very critical for cancer to

792
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,880
advance sort of further and further

793
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,480
along so it's sort of

794
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,320
all of these traits together are really

795
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,880
what we see for cancer to get to a stage

796
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,080
where it's like

797
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,120
clinically observable and you know it's

798
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,720
something that needs to be treated we

799
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,320
have all of these things happening

800
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,880
together

801
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,799
all right um

802
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,320
sorry i just wanted to check something

803
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,640
all right

804
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,640
so i did mention this but i do want to

805
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,720
uh emphasize it again because it comes

806
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,120
up a lot with how we think about the

807
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,120
data that we get from characterizing

808
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,120
cancer um and so we're going to talk

809
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,559
later about or we're going to talk in a

810
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,679
second about how

811
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,159
we characterize cancer you know cancer

812
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:12,799
is sort of

813
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,559
the result of all these genetic

814
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,720
mutations right so it's the evidence is

815
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,200
in the dna right if you extract

816
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,120
a cancer cell and look at its dna you

817
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,640
can see all of these things

818
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,360
happening right you can see genes being

819
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,520
changed or lost or

820
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,880
new copies of being pasted in

821
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,960
but i wanted to be clear that not every

822
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,880
mutation you've seen a cancer cell

823
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,600
is directly contributing to the cancer

824
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,960
being the way it is

825
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,200
right we we get lots of random mutations

826
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,480
and some of them don't really do

827
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,360
anything

828
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,039
or maybe they do something but it's so

829
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,960
slight and it's not contributing

830
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,159
to the cell being cancerous um and so

831
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,600
the way we think of that

832
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,520
about them is what we call the ex the

833
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,919
difference between a driver mutation

834
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,200
versus a passenger mutation and so as

835
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,320
we're growing as our cells are dividing

836
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,039
and you know

837
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,520
we're accumulating these mutations some

838
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,640
of those mutations

839
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,799
don't really have any purpose or any

840
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,360
role like maybe they slightly alter a

841
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:11,919
process

842
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,159
in that single cell but it's not enough

843
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,840
to contribute to the cancer in a

844
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,200
meaningful way

845
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,080
and so again when i say you need the

846
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,320
constellation of the right mutations all

847
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,520
happening in the same cell

848
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,679
all those mutations need to be driver

849
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,200
mutations they need to actually be

850
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,240
actively

851
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,120
something that uh is part of the cancer

852
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,720
process they can't just be random

853
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,520
mutations

854
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,679
anywhere a lot of those mutations either

855
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,440
don't do anything or they just don't do

856
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,159
anything that's

857
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,320
relevant to cancer and so you can

858
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,840
imagine when we're sifting through this

859
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,679
data where we have all of

860
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,840
these you know cancer genomes and we're

861
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,120
trying to figure out

862
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,200
okay well what went wrong here there's

863
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,799
actually going to be tons of mutations

864
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,080
we see in the data

865
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,840
that have nothing to do with the cancer

866
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,360
they're just mutations

867
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,039
they either do nothing or they just

868
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,559
don't do something that's cancer

869
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,360
relevant

870
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,919
and so that's something as sort of data

871
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,919
detectives that we need to keep in mind

872
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,760
is figuring out what is

873
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,200
we don't just want what is the most

874
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,279
common mutation we want a communication

875
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,320
that is actually

876
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,720
relevant to the cancer being the way it

877
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,880
is

878
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,320
and i just bring that up to say that

879
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,240
there's been a lot of efforts

880
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,000
to characterize the genetics of cancer

881
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
so if you're not already familiar with

882
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,600
tcga

883
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,320
it's called the cancer genome atlas and

884
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,600
as the name would imply

885
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,840
it's sort of this massively funded and

886
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,799
coordinated effort to just collect

887
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,279
many samples of a certain type of cancer

888
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,039
so for example they might be like okay

889
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,960
we're going to study kidney cancer

890
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,039
so they collect tons of kidney cancer

891
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,960
samples from lots of different patients

892
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,640
and they sequence them all to sort of

893
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,159
have this bank of data

894
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,240
um you know this you know here is a

895
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,000
genome example from

896
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,640
you know kidney cancer patient one

897
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,520
through

898
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,159
a thousand um and the goal of this has

899
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,000
just been to then try to figure out okay

900
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,760
when we're looking at kidney cancer

901
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,480
what is being mutated does that give us

902
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,159
more insight into how the cancer is

903
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:07,039
happening

904
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,919
or how we could possibly treat it and

905
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,200
you are welcome like

906
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,799
the data is in many cases open for study

907
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,799
if you want a more guided way to study

908
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,480
it i highly recommend

909
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,520
cbioportal.org which will let you

910
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,520
search through this data set but it

911
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,880
actually guides you and does a lot of

912
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,720
the visualizations for you

913
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,240
chances are you could probably access

914
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,399
the data on your own if you want more

915
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,440
closer to the raw data but you can start

916
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,000
to see

917
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,840
that um cancers are actually quite

918
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,200
different from each other i'm not going

919
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,480
to even fully touch on

920
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,279
that in this talk but you know if we're

921
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,720
comparing a kidney cancer

922
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,039
to skin cancer to brain cancer there's

923
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,159
actually quite a few

924
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,360
differences in what we observe

925
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,880
in from the data from those different

926
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,399
types of cancers they all fall under the

927
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,159
umbrella of cancer

928
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,919
but technically depending on where the

929
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,519
cancer is happening the

930
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,519
the way it comes about can be very

931
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,840
different

932
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,679
all right um i'm going to now transition

933
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,840
into thinking about diagnosis so that's

934
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,360
sort of the background

935
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,799
all about cancer how it's caused what is

936
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,159
going on

937
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,000
and i hope some of that molecular

938
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,159
context then helps make uh

939
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,080
the data makes the data that we collect

940
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,760
makes sense because again when we're

941
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,240
trying to

942
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,760
understand cancer we're actually

943
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,360
collecting a lot of data that's looking

944
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,720
into what's happening

945
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,120
at the protein level or at the dna level

946
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,799
or the mrna level

947
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,240
so that's the data we're actually

948
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,000
collecting and needing to sift through

949
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,279
so it just helps to see

950
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,519
what does what does that mrna mean what

951
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,399
does the protein

952
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,760
mean in the context of cancer

953
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,440
are any questions before i move on to

954
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,000
the next thing

955
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,919
all right so let's start off we're

956
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,320
thinking about

957
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,320
diagnosing cancer um so i'm just going

958
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,080
to give you an example so we have a

959
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,440
neighbor our neighbor is

960
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,080
sasha um they are a local bartender they

961
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,240
like to hike they like to play guitar

962
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,080
they haven't really had any serious

963
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,519
medical issues

964
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,679
um they do have a family history of

965
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,840
melanoma but otherwise you know

966
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,000
nothing that they've been diagnosed with

967
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,360
in their own lifetime

968
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,279
but they start to experience symptoms

969
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,679
they start to get abdominal pain

970
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,440
they start to lose weight without the

971
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,039
intention to lose weight

972
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,760
they feel nauseous um they oddly notice

973
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,480
that there's

974
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,840
pain in their leg so the leg is kind of

975
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,799
swollen

976
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,120
looks inflamed there's a change in the

977
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,120
color of their urine and all of these

978
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,679
worrying symptoms prompt them to go to

979
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:42,880
the doctor

980
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,919
i'm just curious if you have any guesses

981
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,360
what do you think this could be

982
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,120
anyone want to share in zoom chat what

983
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:57,679
this could be

984
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,880
just had a random guess

985
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,480
yeah it's some type of cancer so

986
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,919
someone's pointing out maybe kidney

987
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,120
cancer

988
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,279
given that there's a change in the color

989
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,799
of their urine

990
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,679
any other guesses

991
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,159
all right

992
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,200
so obviously we're gonna go to the

993
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,600
doctor with all of these symptoms and so

994
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,440
the doctor is gonna go through some sort

995
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,360
of process to try to figure out

996
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,519
what is going on um so i will say

997
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,679
when you're looking at cancer at the

998
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:42,720
stage at which

999
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,559
it's causing symptoms

1000
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,360
um at the stage at which a person is

1001
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,679
experiencing something like yeah like

1002
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,279
like these different symptoms

1003
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,720
at that stage the cancer is usually

1004
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,279
large enough that you start to have what

1005
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,000
we call like

1006
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,679
gross features like things you could

1007
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,679
just observe

1008
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,200
and i just want to give you an example

1009
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,919
of that when you're looking at

1010
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,399
a tumor so let's say that you imagine

1011
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,440
you could kind of just like

1012
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,239
take a slice of the tissue if you know

1013
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,520
where to look

1014
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,040
if you're looking at that tissue you can

1015
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,960
already tell that something's wrong if

1016
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,000
it's at the stage where the

1017
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,879
person's experiencing symptoms um

1018
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,159
chances are you'll

1019
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,199
notice the large abnormal growths

1020
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,760
like the architecture of the tissue will

1021
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,119
be off

1022
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,399
right like our you know through very

1023
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,000
interesting miracles that you can learn

1024
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,079
about in developmental biology

1025
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,239
somehow our cells know to grow into

1026
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,918
certain 3d

1027
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,839
shapes right like it develops into

1028
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,520
tissues and the tissues come together

1029
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,359
somehow in the correct way for us to be

1030
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:48,560
functional

1031
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,280
and so when you're looking at cancer in

1032
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,359
a specific tissue that architecture is

1033
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,359
way off it's not just really necessarily

1034
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,960
that they'll just be this giant

1035
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,560
growth where there isn't supposed to be

1036
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,960
but it often will sort of remodel

1037
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,800
a lot of the tissue around it and you'll

1038
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,560
see things that are abnormal i already

1039
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,520
gave the example

1040
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,079
of blood vessels will start to spring up

1041
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,160
where they don't normally show up

1042
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,839
because they're trying to feed this

1043
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,599
growing mass

1044
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,359
all of that is sort of the influence of

1045
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,040
the cancer changing

1046
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,079
the layout around it and so even if you

1047
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,680
just took a slice you can kind of tell

1048
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,520
hey something's wrong here

1049
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,440
and the joke was when i was in my cancer

1050
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,119
biology research program

1051
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,839
a lot of us was very molecular oriented

1052
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,160
not many of us had clinical experience

1053
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,160
but even we could kind of look at these

1054
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,520
side-by-side

1055
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,839
histologies these cut out tissues and

1056
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:38,880
see hey

1057
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,880
this just looks chaotic like there's

1058
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,240
something wrong here

1059
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,000
this is probably the cancer sample as

1060
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,200
opposed to the normal sample just

1061
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:45,839
because of how

1062
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,320
messy it looks and a lot of that

1063
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,760
messiness also is

1064
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,079
observable at the cellular level so

1065
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,760
shown here on the right is a comparison

1066
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,400
of sort of

1067
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,960
normal cells versus cancer cells and you

1068
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,960
can already tell that there's something

1069
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,440
way more chaotic about these cancer

1070
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,640
cells

1071
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,480
they don't usually sort of sit nicely

1072
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,400
with other cells normally other cells

1073
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:06,960
will

1074
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,960
sit nicely in like a sheet and sort of

1075
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,720
all hold hands together

1076
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,800
if it's a cancer cell it doesn't hold

1077
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,000
hands it's kind of more

1078
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,960
mobile mobile it's not connected to

1079
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,480
things it's kind of going

1080
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,720
rogue and it also just is very um

1081
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,920
uh diverse in terms of like the size and

1082
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,680
the shape like normally they're fairly

1083
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,599
uniform if they're all cells in the same

1084
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,520
tissue serving the same purpose

1085
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,440
but cancer cells don't obey those rules

1086
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,599
anymore so they start to

1087
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,680
change in their size and their shape and

1088
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,359
they lose a lot of the features we'd

1089
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:40,400
expect

1090
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,760
and the one thing i want to point out is

1091
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,560
that they have these larger nuclei

1092
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,040
and some of that is actually because of

1093
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,119
the fact that they might be

1094
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,079
duplicating chromosomes and their dna is

1095
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:52,400
like

1096
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,040
quite abnormal compared to the normal

1097
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,480
cell so the dna will look at

1098
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,480
or the nucleus will actually look larger

1099
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,880
than we would expect

1100
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,079
so we can see all these features if we

1101
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,920
know where to look i'll just say that

1102
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,119
you know obviously we don't

1103
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,440
necessarily know where to look and so

1104
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,520
when we're trying to diagnose a cancer

1105
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,359
we often rely on some sort of

1106
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,920
imaging um so we can use things like

1107
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,040
ultrasound

1108
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,599
um pet scans mr mris to look again for

1109
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:22,640
something

1110
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,640
about the expected architecture of the

1111
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,880
area that looks different

1112
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,400
depending on the type of cancer

1113
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,760
something that we think might be in the

1114
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,599
blood we can look at a blood smear and

1115
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:31,920
just

1116
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,599
look at the cells that are floating

1117
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,280
around in our blood

1118
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,800
if it's a skin cancer because i know

1119
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,200
some people brought up melanoma

1120
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,960
you could look across the skin it's just

1121
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,119
like a physical examination

1122
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,240
look for moles and try to diagnose based

1123
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,520
on the mole there's actually certain

1124
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,119
characteristics of a mole that tell them

1125
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,240
if it's a more dangerous

1126
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,200
mole versus a benign hole all of these

1127
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,640
are sort of the ways that we would

1128
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,800
hunt around to figure out if we see

1129
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,200
something that's suspicious

1130
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,800
chances are if we find something that

1131
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,560
looks suspicious

1132
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,720
the best way to then really truly know

1133
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,920
that it's cancer

1134
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,960
is to do a biopsy and so very often what

1135
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,400
might happen i'm just gonna give the

1136
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,920
example of lung cancer that doesn't

1137
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,119
happen to be the case

1138
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,560
in this uh today's case study um

1139
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,760
but if you were if they suspect uh were

1140
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,000
suspicious that you had lung cancer

1141
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,240
they might have found that out by doing

1142
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,359
this imaging

1143
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,240
um so mr mri or ultrasound they might

1144
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,560
see like a mass that's like abnormal

1145
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,320
like the density of the tissue where

1146
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,079
that tissue is located it just might be

1147
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,960
weird the pet scan actually shows them

1148
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,160
where there's an area of

1149
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,520
high metabolic activity which is more

1150
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,040
likely with cancers you can imagine

1151
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,960
something that's growing and dividing so

1152
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,440
much

1153
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,640
is churning through lots of energy

1154
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,800
and so that that growing tumor is

1155
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,760
actually hungry

1156
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,720
like it wants lots of food and sugar to

1157
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,320
feed itself to power

1158
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,240
dividing so much and so if you're

1159
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,240
looking at a pet scan you don't expect

1160
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,800
this random mass of metabolic activity

1161
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,560
but that might be a sign that points to

1162
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,400
a tumor in that area

1163
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,320
and so let's say they have all of that

1164
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,440
evidence so far

1165
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,880
the best thing they could do then if

1166
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,320
they suspect maybe you have a lung

1167
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,040
cancer

1168
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,839
is to take a tissue sample and they

1169
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,920
don't want to do that willy-nilly

1170
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,119
right like taking a sample of your lungs

1171
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,040
is not ideal especially if you're let's

1172
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,400
say an older patient

1173
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,640
but that might be the best thing to do

1174
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,079
if they really truly

1175
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,560
have enough evidence to suspect that you

1176
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,920
have lung cancer

1177
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,440
because that's the most definitive right

1178
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,119
to look at the

1179
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,520
the tissue up close to look at the cells

1180
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,280
in the tissue

1181
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,040
that is the best way to diagnose a

1182
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,359
cancer currently

1183
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,560
are there any questions about that

1184
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,839
all right so one question what is that

1185
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:55,119
so when you talk about this biopsy

1186
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,680
taking the cells out of this potential

1187
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,119
tumor

1188
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,640
location so what doctor will look into

1189
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,960
is the sequence sequence of dna or

1190
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,319
anything else

1191
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,880
yeah so the first thing they will check

1192
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,440
is

1193
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,680
the histology so they will really truly

1194
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,880
just want to look

1195
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,480
at an up-close sample of the cells right

1196
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,720
so in all of the other things they just

1197
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,720
see like this blurry mass

1198
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,480
and a well-trained doctor knows that

1199
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,240
that blurry mass might be off

1200
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,160
but really the best way to discern

1201
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,079
cancer is by looking at like a

1202
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,480
cut out of the tissue where the cancer

1203
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,280
lies

1204
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,599
so they can see the abnormality of those

1205
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,760
cells and what they're doing

1206
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,560
a well-trained doctor can tell like like

1207
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,920
they're dividing they're dividing

1208
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,400
rapidly look how much they are

1209
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,760
like abnormal relative to what uh lung

1210
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,440
tissue should look like and how much

1211
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,720
they've disrupted the

1212
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,599
area um so that would be like the first

1213
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:52,000
pass

1214
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,599
just to really be able to diagnose this

1215
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,359
is actually cancer

1216
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,359
you are right that they will often do

1217
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,440
some sort of genetic characterization if

1218
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,280
that will guide the treatment

1219
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,240
or if it might tell them um there are

1220
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,000
some cancers where we do sort of

1221
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,920
stratify like oh it's not just you have

1222
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,160
cancer you have cancer that is

1223
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,720
blank positive or negative where blank

1224
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,560
is the genetic marker so they might do

1225
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,560
some early genetic characterizations if

1226
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,400
it makes sense for the kind of cancer

1227
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,000
they're looking at um

1228
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,920
so for lung cancer there is a genetic

1229
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,599
marker that's commonly looked at so they

1230
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,920
might do that early characterization

1231
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,079
um they probably don't do something like

1232
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,440
sequencing the whole thing

1233
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,119
um that is kind of something they just

1234
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,720
don't do

1235
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,920
okay yeah so and another another thing

1236
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,200
is that recently

1237
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,560
uh d-mine uh accomplished this a

1238
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,160
huge breakthrough in protein folding

1239
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,599
all right so can protein folding help

1240
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,920
anything in this diet in this domain do

1241
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,839
diagnosis or treatment

1242
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,440
i'm like sorry about my lacking

1243
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,720
knowledge environment i don't know

1244
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,400
that's uh that's an interesting question

1245
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,160
because um i think one thing that i

1246
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,040
didn't emphasize is that cancer is by

1247
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,560
and large a genetic thing

1248
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,560
and so for example by and large

1249
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,720
what is making the cells abnormal is

1250
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,200
that their recipe for certain genes has

1251
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,720
changed

1252
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,839
but technically there can be ways that

1253
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:18,880
cancer is

1254
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,599
i don't know if it could account for 100

1255
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:22,800
of the cause but the

1256
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,960
things that can contribute cancer can be

1257
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,200
technically non-genetic

1258
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:32,079
um so what we've noticed is there can be

1259
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,079
things that are not at the genetic level

1260
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,440
that actually encourage

1261
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,960
cancer behavior and so what you're

1262
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,560
talking about where it's like oh well

1263
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,280
maybe the the recipe for the protein

1264
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,280
doesn't change but the way the protein

1265
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,000
folds changes that could technically

1266
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,720
encourage

1267
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,000
cancer if the weight folds for example

1268
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,920
makes it less functional or more

1269
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,000
functional right because basically

1270
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,200
the the whole of what a protein does is

1271
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,640
based on its shape

1272
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,880
and if the shape changes what it does

1273
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,920
changes

1274
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,079
um so yeah that's an interesting point i

1275
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,680
don't know of any

1276
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,920
really solid examples off the top of my

1277
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,960
head but

1278
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,040
theoretically it's very sound to say if

1279
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,880
there was some way in which

1280
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,119
a particular gene and the protein it

1281
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,079
makes

1282
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,240
the recipe didn't change but the way it

1283
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,280
folded kept

1284
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,920
changing that could contribute to cancer

1285
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,640
um

1286
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,319
i don't know an example of the top of my

1287
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:25,839
head but theoretically that does make

1288
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:26,880
sense because ultimately

1289
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,960
the end product if it somehow still ends

1290
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,000
up being different

1291
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,319
like it stops working for example that

1292
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,400
could be contributing to cancer

1293
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,560
thank you yeah awesome

1294
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,720
um so let's talk about this first

1295
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,800
example which is our friend sasha um

1296
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,200
they get an ultrasound a ct case again

1297
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,960
a pet scan i'm just showing you the

1298
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,480
images um they don't mean a ton to me

1299
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,480
because i am not a clinician i'm very

1300
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,760
much molecular

1301
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,079
computational biologist but if you are a

1302
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,760
well-trained doctor you will notice that

1303
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,319
there are

1304
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:04,560
shadows or masses or bright signals

1305
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,480
not where they're not supposed to be or

1306
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,079
in a shape that they're not supposed to

1307
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,000
be and so ultimately the doctor actually

1308
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,040
diagnoses sasha with pancreatic cancer

1309
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,599
and so my question for you all is um

1310
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,359
this is your friend sasha their your

1311
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,280
neighbor you've known them for a while

1312
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,720
you hear that they have pancreatic

1313
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,640
cancer what is your first

1314
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,400
question when you hear this news

1315
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,079
and you can just type in zoom chat what

1316
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,440
would be the first thing that comes to

1317
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,839
mind

1318
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,200
so i'm saying how far has spread is it

1319
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,680
recoverable like can you be treated what

1320
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,640
stage is it

1321
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,680
can you get surgery for it all of these

1322
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,280
are very great questions

1323
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,760
um yeah you might have tons of different

1324
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,160
reactions or questions i will say

1325
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,480
probably the most common one does get at

1326
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,000
this which is sort of what are your

1327
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:06,640
options

1328
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,520
how bad is it uh that tends to be our

1329
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,440
first reaction and what that's hinting

1330
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,920
at when we think about that is actually

1331
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,000
what stage is your cancer and so if

1332
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,680
you're not familiar with cancer staging

1333
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,040
that just reflects

1334
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,319
really how far it's progressed so

1335
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:25,680
an early stage so you know stage one

1336
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,079
is something that tends to be smaller it

1337
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:28,960
tends to be

1338
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,520
very localized so for example if it's a

1339
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,640
cancer of the lung

1340
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,200
it just shows up on one lung in one

1341
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,119
place that would be an early stage

1342
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:38,640
cancer

1343
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,280
as we move towards stage two stage three

1344
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,400
stage four

1345
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,839
that means that we suspect that the

1346
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:46,400
cancer has maybe moved from one lung

1347
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,319
to the other lung maybe it's moved from

1348
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:51,040
that lung to somewhere else in the body

1349
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,760
um basically the farther it's spread

1350
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,720
that's where we have

1351
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,839
later stages um stage

1352
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,839
one through four is usually what we talk

1353
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:01,440
about sort of

1354
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,040
in more common interactions technically

1355
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,960
at the doctor's level we have like a

1356
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,480
more

1357
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,400
sophisticated uh system of

1358
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,640
of looking at things like we wonder like

1359
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,160
what is the relative size

1360
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,960
of the tumor and how much has it invaded

1361
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,079
locally

1362
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,160
and then we will examine lymph nodes

1363
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,000
because that's a very common sort of um

1364
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,200
transit transit opportunity for a cell

1365
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,000
if a cell is

1366
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,800
leaving one organ to go to another organ

1367
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,400
the lymph nodes are

1368
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,480
one of the major sort of highways that

1369
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,560
they take so one thing they might do is

1370
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,200
they might

1371
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,400
look into the lymph nodes nearby and see

1372
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,920
if they see a crazy

1373
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,880
abnormal lung cancer cell in the lymph

1374
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,560
node which really stands out because

1375
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,000
normally in the lymph nodes you maybe

1376
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
have like types of immune cells

1377
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,240
you don't expect to see a lung cell in

1378
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,440
the lymph nodes they might

1379
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,839
check to see if they observe that and

1380
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:59,680
again depending on the patient if they

1381
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,200
notice oh this patient

1382
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,560
has um you know we diagnose them with

1383
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,000
lung cancer but we also notice the

1384
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,040
suspicious mass

1385
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,240
appearing on their kidneys that is

1386
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,240
evidence of a metastasis which is that

1387
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,359
the cancer is spread

1388
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,319
really from one organ to another organ

1389
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,319
and so these do kind of map stage one

1390
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:19,920
through four kind of map to this

1391
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,800
tnm system but this is a little bit of a

1392
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,000
more detailed system showing

1393
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,400
you how they kind of arrive at saying

1394
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,760
you're stage three they're kind of

1395
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,280
looking at all these different features

1396
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,160
and i will just say um it's not just

1397
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,599
size and invasion

1398
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,520
sometimes they are looking at the cells

1399
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,800
themselves

1400
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,880
so for example um this is more common in

1401
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,119
something like prostate cancer which is

1402
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:43,440
that

1403
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,359
it's not just a matter of like how big

1404
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,440
is the tumor how far is it spread

1405
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,280
um they actually are looking at like the

1406
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,359
cells themselves to see like how

1407
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:52,720
different do they look from what we

1408
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,880
expect like do they look like what we

1409
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,880
expect prostate tissue to look like

1410
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,839
or how different are they because

1411
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:01,359
usually

1412
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:04,319
less normal is is evidence that it's

1413
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:04,800
actually

1414
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,240
worse so um normally the the prostate

1415
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,000
tissue is supposed to form these sort of

1416
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,119
like small little

1417
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,680
gland structures and as you can see on

1418
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,800
this spectrum

1419
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,200
as it starts to not really even form

1420
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,040
that structure anymore that's a sign

1421
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,079
that the cells are just

1422
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,240
more and more abnormal and so when

1423
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,920
you're staging the cancer and you look

1424
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,200
and you see oh like

1425
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,160
maybe one patient's pancreatic cancer

1426
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:28,640
sorry

1427
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,359
prostate cancer looks closer to the top

1428
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:32,720
and one prostate cancer

1429
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,119
sample looks closer to the bottom the

1430
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:36,640
person whose sample looks close to the

1431
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,079
bottom you'd actually expect that their

1432
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:39,040
cancer maybe is

1433
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,000
more aggressive or is harder to treat

1434
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,920
and so that might be additional

1435
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,839
information that impacts your staging

1436
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:48,960
decision

1437
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,839
so when we're looking at sasha's case uh

1438
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,119
sasha's tumor

1439
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,200
measures two inches across there's a

1440
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,280
presence of cancer cells in the nearby

1441
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,400
liver

1442
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,640
there's high metabolic activity in three

1443
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,319
nearby lymph nodes

1444
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:04,559
and then if you recall sasha's symptoms

1445
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,160
they have leg pain

1446
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,480
they have a abnormal color in their

1447
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,359
urine

1448
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,400
how would you stage sasha's cancer

1449
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,839
based on this information

1450
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,640
yeah it sounds fairly late stage

1451
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,720
um and so i just wanted to point out

1452
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,240
something like leg pain

1453
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,040
could be evidence that cells maybe are

1454
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:35,760
in

1455
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,079
lymph nodes nearby and causing them to

1456
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:39,200
swell

1457
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,440
um as we mentioned like someone thought

1458
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,520
oh maybe it's kidney cancer

1459
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,760
because it sounds like it's affecting

1460
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,280
the kidneys well maybe it wasn't

1461
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,200
originally from the kidneys it's those

1462
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,040
cells have moved to kidneys and are

1463
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,720
affecting their ability to function

1464
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,079
normally

1465
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,839
so yeah this would be fairly late stage

1466
00:49:56,839 --> 00:49:58,240
cancer

1467
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,680
and so i just wanted to walk you through

1468
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,440
this example to show you really like

1469
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,520
this is the process by which we are

1470
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,160
understanding

1471
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,319
someone's cancer currently i mean i'm

1472
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:10,240
not a clinician but this is by and large

1473
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,119
sort of the most

1474
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,359
common way it's probably the most

1475
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:15,359
accessible way when we don't have the

1476
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:16,079
means to do

1477
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,200
tons of fancy genotyping um and and

1478
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,280
surveillance of someone's body

1479
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,359
um but this is just how someone would

1480
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,720
find out they have cancers

1481
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,760
usually they show some sort of symptom

1482
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,839
in some cases they might be screened

1483
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:31,680
screenings a whole nother conversation

1484
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:32,559
but they might

1485
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:35,119
show symptoms they go in they get some

1486
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,559
imaging done they might then get a

1487
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,640
biopsy if they see something suspicious

1488
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,480
and then that's where they start to sort

1489
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,680
of put the pieces together and figure

1490
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,800
out what stage are you

1491
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,880
and that guides treatment generally

1492
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,400
speaking

1493
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,960
so this is a great uh i don't know if

1494
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,480
you guys usually do like five minute

1495
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,000
breaks this would be a great

1496
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,760
stopping point if people want a bathroom

1497
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,079
break

1498
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,920
hi marisa just two minutes before we get

1499
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,079
started i'm just very curious about the

1500
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:07,839
car in the

1501
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:11,119
strategy for kovi 19 because they have

1502
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:12,880
you have these new mutations keep on

1503
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,000
coming out

1504
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,839
and similar to the cancer mutations

1505
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:20,880
so kind of worry about it yeah i mean

1506
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,400
i think so

1507
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,119
ultimately

1508
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:31,760
when it comes to these mutations um

1509
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:35,280
like i'm to be honest like immunology

1510
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,800
isn't super my strong point

1511
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,599
um but i will say that in general when

1512
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:42,000
we're thinking about

1513
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,200
immunity the

1514
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,760
the covid virus right like will have a

1515
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,599
particular shape and architecture and

1516
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:50,160
ultimately

1517
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,680
what you're just hoping is that your

1518
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,920
immune cells will realize this is

1519
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,920
something really problematic and have

1520
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:56,480
like a

1521
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,200
strong enough rejection response fast

1522
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,319
enough right

1523
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:03,200
you don't like for a lot of people the

1524
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,400
issue is that

1525
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,720
they do have something somewhere that

1526
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,920
will respond to

1527
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,079
a covet virus but at that point the copa

1528
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:11,920
virus is starting to infect the

1529
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,680
infection is spreading

1530
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,400
and so it's kind of like they've been

1531
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,559
stealthily invaded before they mount

1532
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,920
a large enough response fast enough um

1533
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,480
and so with the vaccine trying to get

1534
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,160
people to like really have that

1535
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,559
quick immediate reaction right away to

1536
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:30,160
just reject it

1537
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:34,160
um i think there can be mutations in

1538
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,079
viruses that aren't necessarily

1539
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:38,640
changing like you know it's like a a

1540
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,480
tiger changes its spots like it's

1541
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,680
some of those mutations aren't

1542
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,920
necessarily changing the outside

1543
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,160
arrangement that we recognize i mean

1544
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,760
some of them do

1545
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,359
i think that's something that's really

1546
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:52,079
tough with you know things like

1547
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:54,880
uh the seasonal flu it's like they are

1548
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,960
changing their spots often and so we

1549
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,200
just don't have the same

1550
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,680
immune reaction quick enough as it

1551
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:02,800
starts to change

1552
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,880
the features that we recognize right

1553
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,240
like the things we're looking for are

1554
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,400
literally changing

1555
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,000
some of the mutations might change

1556
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,160
things that aren't that particular

1557
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,040
protein

1558
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,640
on the surface they could be other

1559
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,079
things right

1560
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,760
um but yeah i think as long as

1561
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,680
the tiger is changing its spots and

1562
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,119
those features are changing

1563
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:25,680
then yeah it could be that our immune

1564
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,200
response to them is weaker and at some

1565
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,000
point maybe we don't

1566
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,760
have the same immune response at all and

1567
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,359
then we need a new vaccine to like

1568
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:33,839
prompt us to respond to that one instead

1569
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,440
so i think some people who've said like

1570
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,920
depending on the degree of the mutation

1571
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,839
um and whether it's always kind of in

1572
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:42,000
these recognizable

1573
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,800
outer proteins that might prompt us to

1574
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,000
just keep having like

1575
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
updated vaccines the same way we do the

1576
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,040
seasonal flu

1577
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,520
um but it could be the case that also is

1578
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,599
mutating in ways that don't affect that

1579
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:54,960
surface protein

1580
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,839
okay thank you so much yeah yeah i

1581
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:59,760
noticed we're at time so i'm going to

1582
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,680
resume and now we're going to sort of

1583
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,000
really segue into thinking about where

1584
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:04,480
does

1585
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,359
machine learning and ai come in and so

1586
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,800
honestly this is kind of

1587
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,480
when i'm thinking about machine learning

1588
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,079
this is kind of again how i break it

1589
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:13,520
down right thinking about the difference

1590
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,240
between

1591
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,880
a supervised task versus an unsupervised

1592
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,040
task and all of the methods associated

1593
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,319
with those

1594
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:21,680
and i just want to give you examples of

1595
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,359
the types of things we think about

1596
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:26,000
in cancer that relate to each of these

1597
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:26,880
areas

1598
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,119
so for example a lot of work we do is

1599
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,319
unsupervised

1600
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:31,839
and i'll just say that that's because

1601
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:34,240
with something like biology there's so

1602
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,000
much open-endedness where we're just

1603
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,760
trying to discover

1604
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,680
what is happening what is this how does

1605
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,799
it work

1606
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:42,559
and so there's a lot of unsupervised

1607
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:45,920
tasks so there might be something like

1608
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,319
figuring out what are the different

1609
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,280
types of

1610
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,920
tumors in patients right so we might

1611
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,559
have some

1612
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:57,040
big disease like all of lung cancer

1613
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,640
but maybe if we're sort of doing an

1614
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,960
unsupervised analysis we might realize

1615
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,799
oh there seems to be these different

1616
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,599
types of lung cancer all under this

1617
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:07,119
umbrella

1618
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:09,280
um and so that's just at the level of

1619
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,160
looking across

1620
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,760
patients but you could go a little

1621
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,559
further and say oh well we're taking

1622
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:16,880
samples of lung cancer cells and you

1623
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,400
might realize oh there's different

1624
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,160
types of lung cancer cells right it's

1625
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,440
actually kind of a

1626
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,160
heterogeneous space not every lung

1627
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,359
cancer

1628
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:27,920
cell in a in one person's tumor is

1629
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,359
actually the same

1630
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,440
and so as we're doing sort of this

1631
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,440
unguided analysis where we're just

1632
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,040
looking for what is there what is the

1633
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,720
diversity there are there certain

1634
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,640
clusters or archetypes

1635
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,040
we might discover oh in lung cancer we

1636
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,960
tend to notice that there's

1637
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,319
this common cell type alpha beta you

1638
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:48,000
know just i'm making something up but

1639
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,160
like we do a lot of this type analysis

1640
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,520
just because

1641
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,680
previously we haven't had this level of

1642
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,640
detail

1643
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,359
available to us about lung cancer you

1644
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:59,119
know either at the single cell level

1645
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:00,960
or just not enough samples to be able to

1646
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,040
appreciate what is there

1647
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,200
and so we do a lot of unsupervised work

1648
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,880
a lot of visualizations a lot of

1649
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,559
clustering to just figure out what is

1650
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:11,440
the diversity of things within a given

1651
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,040
cancer

1652
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,440
we do do a lot of supervised tasks so we

1653
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,200
do a lot of trying to be able to better

1654
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,720
discern

1655
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,119
normal patients versus tumor patients or

1656
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,200
trying to relate

1657
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,160
tumor types to like their prognosis and

1658
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,359
their survival

1659
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:29,119
so we do a lot of these more guided

1660
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,040
tasks they tend to be the much more

1661
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,960
clinical ones i'd say the unsupervised

1662
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,119
ones tend to be the more

1663
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:36,720
figuring out how cancer works we're

1664
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,799
still many or many decades later

1665
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:40,640
figuring out how cancer works and a lot

1666
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,319
of the supervised ones tend to be

1667
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:45,839
very clinically relevant like how can we

1668
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:47,760
automate sort of this ability to

1669
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,680
diagnose patients just based on a

1670
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,319
certain type of data that we collect

1671
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:54,960
and so there's lots of things that

1672
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,079
relate i think

1673
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,920
going from machine learning into cancer

1674
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,520
biology

1675
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,559
um and we have lots of data i think the

1676
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:04,319
tough thing with biology is our data is

1677
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:05,200
very messy

1678
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:08,000
as soon as you work with real world real

1679
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:08,799
life things

1680
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:11,760
things get very messy but i will share

1681
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:12,319
that we just

1682
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:14,799
we measure many things in biology we

1683
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:16,480
measure many different types of things

1684
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,240
at different levels of scale at

1685
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,040
different levels

1686
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,319
in the biological process um we have

1687
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:23,920
things like sequencing we have things

1688
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,319
like imaging we have things where we're

1689
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:29,680
looking at the three the the spatial

1690
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:30,720
arrangement of

1691
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,280
cells um we might be looking at the

1692
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,680
proteins in a given cell so we have

1693
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,920
all this kinds of different data that we

1694
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,200
look at and i'm going to go through and

1695
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,880
explain a couple of these different data

1696
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:41,599
types

1697
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:45,040
and how they relate to cancer

1698
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,720
so we talked about this already this

1699
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,960
idea that we have the dna which is our

1700
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,200
sort of recipe book it tells us you know

1701
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,079
what how do you make any given protein

1702
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:55,119
and so the dna

1703
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:57,760
and what's going on in our cells the dna

1704
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,200
is being copied into

1705
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,359
rna which is sort of this temporary

1706
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:02,880
intermediate it's kind of like a

1707
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,200
photocopy of the recipe book

1708
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,480
that photocopy floats out and goes to

1709
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,680
a ribosome which is where the protein is

1710
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,839
constructed so it references

1711
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:16,559
your your photocopied recipe and uses

1712
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,160
that to then put the right pieces

1713
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,920
together to make a particular type of

1714
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,040
protein

1715
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,680
and so if we're looking at these steps

1716
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,920
we basically can collect data at each

1717
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:26,319
step

1718
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:28,160
of this process so we can collect data

1719
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,799
about the dna we can collect data about

1720
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:32,640
the rna that's floating around in our

1721
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,799
cells we can collect it about what

1722
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:37,119
proteins we have floating around in our

1723
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:38,319
cells

1724
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:40,799
um i will just say one underappreciated

1725
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:42,240
part of this process

1726
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,680
is actually that our dna isn't just sort

1727
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,280
of this like

1728
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,920
it's it's it's you know it could be like

1729
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:50,799
a text

1730
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:53,040
corpus right like it's a it's a lot of

1731
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,960
letters in a certain order

1732
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,160
but it's also a 3d physical thing right

1733
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,960
our dna is these molecules and these

1734
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,720
molecules actually have a lot of

1735
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,119
folding and sort of coiling that's

1736
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:05,920
happening

1737
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,440
so there's this really cool world where

1738
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,119
they look at like the 3d structure of

1739
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:10,720
dna and how dna

1740
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,119
basically turns into like knots and

1741
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:14,079
coils

1742
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:16,400
um but i i just bring up this up to say

1743
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,079
that actually that 3d shape

1744
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:21,119
matters in the sense that when we're

1745
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:21,920
expressing

1746
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,440
genes if a gene is sort of super coiled

1747
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,599
it actually becomes sort of hidden away

1748
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:29,520
like it's it's so folded up that we

1749
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,079
can't

1750
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:32,640
reference it anymore and that gene isn't

1751
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:33,839
expressed

1752
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:35,599
versus if there's a part of the dna that

1753
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:37,920
unfurls and uncoils and is very

1754
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,040
accessible

1755
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,040
that gene is easier for the cell to

1756
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,160
express

1757
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,799
and that um that shape that it takes on

1758
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:46,400
is actually very purposeful

1759
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,640
in certain cells they will fold up parts

1760
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,000
of their dna that they're like i don't

1761
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,760
need to use this anymore

1762
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,680
and they'll unfurl the parts they do

1763
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,520
need to use and that's usually relevant

1764
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,880
to the type of cell it is

1765
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,760
right your dna has the instructions to

1766
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:00,079
be

1767
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:01,920
any type of cell in the world but if

1768
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,359
you're a lung cell

1769
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:05,359
you don't need the instructions for how

1770
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:07,119
to be a kidney cell or how to be a skin

1771
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:09,119
cell so you fold up that dna and you

1772
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:10,880
reference the parts that are relevant to

1773
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,319
being a lung cell

1774
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:14,079
and so that 3d architecture actually

1775
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:15,920
really matters and i will talk about an

1776
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,000
example of data where we look at

1777
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,160
what genes are more open and more

1778
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,160
accessible versus which genes are

1779
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,480
closed and that is relevant to looking

1780
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,960
at cancer

1781
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,559
and then one other thing i'll mention is

1782
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,000
that our

1783
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,960
notion of cells is that um this is

1784
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,240
actually kind of relevant when we're

1785
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,359
talking about viruses

1786
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:38,559
is that the surface features of a cell

1787
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:40,319
usually tell us a lot about the cell

1788
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,839
like what it's doing and what kind of

1789
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:43,119
cell it is

1790
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:45,520
and so even if we weren't diving in and

1791
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,200
looking at hey what is the cell sort of

1792
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,400
thinking and doing

1793
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,640
by studying its dna or studying its

1794
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,680
proteins

1795
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,359
if we just look at the outside of the

1796
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:54,880
cell there's usually

1797
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,000
like flags that tell us what the cell is

1798
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,319
like what kind of cell it is and so a

1799
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:02,319
common example is that if we just look

1800
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:03,680
at your blood

1801
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,200
if we take a sample of your blood and

1802
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,880
measure certain flags

1803
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,400
that are present on the outside cell we

1804
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,240
can say oh this is a white blood cell

1805
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,440
specifically it's a t

1806
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,920
cell or this is an immune like an innate

1807
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,359
immunity cell it's a

1808
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:18,079
monocyte versus a red blood cell like

1809
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:20,240
those are things we can um

1810
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,480
detect looking at the flags on the

1811
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,480
outside of the cell so these are all

1812
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,480
things you can measure we can measure

1813
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,119
what is the dna what mrna is it

1814
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:29,920
producing

1815
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,240
what proteins is it producing what

1816
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,319
proteins are on the outside of cell that

1817
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:36,240
make it a certain type of cell versus a

1818
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,599
different type of cell

1819
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:39,599
and we can also tell the not only like

1820
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:41,520
the dna in terms of what mutations it

1821
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,200
might have we can also tell what kind of

1822
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,920
shape the dna is taking on so these are

1823
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,359
all different types of data that we

1824
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:49,119
collect

1825
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:51,520
are there any questions before i kind of

1826
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,240
get into those

1827
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:58,079
all right so probably the most obvious

1828
01:01:58,079 --> 01:01:59,359
one i just talked about

1829
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:02,640
tcga we do a lot of dna sequencing

1830
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,119
this has been aided by the next

1831
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:07,520
generation sequencing

1832
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,640
we used to do sequencing in a very

1833
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:11,119
labor-intensive and

1834
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:14,000
cost intensive way and now we have new

1835
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,599
technologies where we can do dna

1836
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:16,960
sequencing a lot

1837
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,079
faster and a lot cheaper and so this is

1838
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:22,240
a commonly cited plot where before it

1839
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,720
used to cost you know back when

1840
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:28,079
back in the 2000 era um it would cost

1841
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:31,039
millions of dollars to sequence a single

1842
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:32,319
genome right it was a

1843
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:34,880
huge effort took many labs millions of

1844
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:35,599
dollars to get

1845
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:38,400
one genome and nowadays maybe in a week

1846
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,559
or two you could get a genome for closer

1847
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:42,240
to like a thousand dollars and it can

1848
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,760
get cheaper and cheaper all the time as

1849
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,599
the technology gets better

1850
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:47,359
so that has allowed us in many ways

1851
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:48,640
whereas before we couldn't

1852
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,359
study the genome of a cancer now we are

1853
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:52,640
able to collect those samples and

1854
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:53,200
actually

1855
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,280
look at their entire genome as opposed

1856
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,200
to just looking at one mutation at a

1857
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:57,680
time

1858
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:00,400
for example

1859
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:03,839
um i mentioned the example of looking at

1860
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:06,319
the shape of the dna so like is the dna

1861
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:07,760
very open or is it very

1862
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,960
closed um there's two ways we detect

1863
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:11,680
this

1864
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,920
so there's this thing called dna

1865
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:14,880
methylation

1866
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,440
um the long and short of it is that with

1867
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,799
dna methylation

1868
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:21,520
the dna gets like a chemical flag like a

1869
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,960
little modification

1870
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,880
and that modification basically tells

1871
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,200
that dna to shut down

1872
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,200
the dna doesn't disappear right like the

1873
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,799
cells don't usually want to

1874
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:33,839
ever get rid of parts of their dna but

1875
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:35,760
they do like to sort of tag something

1876
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,359
and say okay we're done with this gene

1877
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:39,359
we're not going to express it anymore

1878
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:41,520
and so methylation in this case is just

1879
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,039
this little flag that says okay we're

1880
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:44,880
done with this gene close up shop

1881
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,640
we're going to use something else and

1882
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,160
we're able to detect that

1883
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,640
using a particular type of sequencing so

1884
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,000
it's not just sequencing the dna you're

1885
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,920
sequencing the dna to look for

1886
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,880
where that modification shows up and so

1887
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,079
i could tell you hey

1888
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:01,280
it's not just what the recipe reads

1889
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:04,480
it's that oh this part of the the book

1890
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,400
has been sort of post-it note like this

1891
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,240
is the actively referred to part of the

1892
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,200
book

1893
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,799
versus parts of the book that are almost

1894
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:12,480
like uh taped shut

1895
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,559
like they're just done with the the cell

1896
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,799
is not using that dna anymore

1897
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:18,799
and so this gives us a better picture of

1898
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:20,880
like what the cell is

1899
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,680
in the midst of expressing at any given

1900
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:24,640
time

1901
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:27,520
so there's that methylation flag another

1902
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,839
thing that maybe is a little more

1903
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:32,720
um physically clear is that we can

1904
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:33,520
actually look

1905
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:36,640
at the folding of our dna so normally

1906
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,079
our dna gets kind of

1907
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:40,319
coiled in a way where it's kind of like

1908
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:41,520
beads on a string

1909
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,000
or like if you're winding up a hose

1910
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,440
there's kind of like a spool

1911
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,799
and the dna goes around it um

1912
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:50,960
but some parts of your dna will have

1913
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,119
sort of like dna wound around spools and

1914
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:54,160
then round around

1915
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:55,520
each other and other parts will have the

1916
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:58,480
dna kind of loosely associated with

1917
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,640
the beads but otherwise it's very open

1918
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,680
and accessible

1919
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,520
and so that's shown here on the left

1920
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,359
where there's the closed chromatin

1921
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:08,079
the closed dna very tightly wound you

1922
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:08,720
can't really

1923
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,720
see what's happening in there and

1924
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:13,039
there's the open parts of the dna

1925
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:15,440
and so recently and this was actually at

1926
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,760
stanford they developed a way to

1927
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,000
specifically figure out where are these

1928
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,280
open regions

1929
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,520
so they developed this clever technique

1930
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,280
where something comes in and

1931
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,839
tags the open regions because well the

1932
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:29,760
closed reasons aren't accessible to that

1933
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,200
particular enzyme

1934
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,200
so enzyme goes in it tags all of the

1935
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,720
open regions of dna

1936
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:37,039
it can't get into the closed regions and

1937
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:38,480
then there's a way at the sequencing

1938
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:39,680
level to see oh

1939
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,599
this is the open region where there were

1940
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:42,799
lots of tags

1941
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:44,720
and when there's no tags oh that was the

1942
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:47,119
region in that dna that was closed off

1943
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:48,640
in that particular cell

1944
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,119
just based on how it coiled so this

1945
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:52,799
isn't even a chemical flag anymore it's

1946
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:54,160
just based on like oh this part of the

1947
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,359
dna kind of folded

1948
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:58,640
in on itself and so it's not being used

1949
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:01,599
so this is another piece of data that is

1950
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,000
also

1951
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,680
available and becoming more available

1952
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:06,160
all the time

1953
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,000
so let's look at mrna so we've moved

1954
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,960
from dna how it folds what mutations are

1955
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:13,680
present

1956
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,200
now we're moving to the next level which

1957
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,920
is we were photocopying the dna to get

1958
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,319
rna and that tells us really

1959
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:21,839
what this is getting closer to what the

1960
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:24,880
cell is actually doing right so the dna

1961
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,640
with all those mutations they only

1962
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,319
matter if they affect what this

1963
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:30,559
cell creates right the cell might have

1964
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:31,839
certain mutations but if it's not

1965
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:33,520
producing the mrna and protein then the

1966
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:34,720
mutation kind of doesn't

1967
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,880
make a difference it's just sort of what

1968
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,640
the cell is but not what the cell is

1969
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:39,680
doing

1970
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,440
and so when we look at things like mrna

1971
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,119
and protein we get a better idea of what

1972
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:43,760
the cell is

1973
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,920
actually doing because the mrna and the

1974
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,119
protein are what

1975
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:49,440
what um the parts of the cell that do

1976
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,280
things as opposed to dna which just sort

1977
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,640
of sits there

1978
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,839
so how do we characterize mrna um

1979
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:57,680
there's a way in the past that's very

1980
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,440
quick to just characterize the relative

1981
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:00,000
amounts

1982
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,480
of different mrna and that's what's

1983
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,559
being shown here with these microarrays

1984
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:06,000
which is where they basically

1985
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,440
take uh your they take up they chop up

1986
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,039
the mrna

1987
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:14,400
they adhere it to probes on a

1988
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:18,000
on a on a chip and basically if there's

1989
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,079
less of the probe or more of a probe

1990
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:21,039
it's like a relative

1991
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:23,280
measure then it turns different colors

1992
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,119
so if you compare two samples let's say

1993
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:25,359
a

1994
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:29,200
normal lung tissue versus a lung cancer

1995
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,559
tissue

1996
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:32,960
the relative proportions of each type of

1997
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,119
gene will stain different colors so if

1998
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:35,599
there's

1999
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:38,640
more in the lung cancer sample it might

2000
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,559
turn red versus if there's more in the

2001
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:41,760
normal sample

2002
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,839
it might turn green and so you get this

2003
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:46,079
relative measure of how much mrna there

2004
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:47,119
is in let's say

2005
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:50,319
tumor versus normal and this was the

2006
01:07:50,319 --> 01:07:52,160
original way we did it it was cheap it

2007
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,200
was fast

2008
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,119
and just gave us this readout on genes

2009
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:56,240
that are maybe

2010
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,400
expressed more in cancer or expressed

2011
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,160
less in cancer

2012
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,000
what we actually use now which we were

2013
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,200
talking about a bit is

2014
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,839
rna sequencing so it's kind of the same

2015
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:07,920
as dna sequencing but it's at the rna

2016
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,359
level so rather than collecting

2017
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:12,079
all of the dna and all of the genes we

2018
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:14,160
collect all of the rna that the cell has

2019
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,479
happened to create at that given time

2020
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:18,319
and we figure out okay well what genes

2021
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:19,759
are represented

2022
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:22,719
in these mrna what is it in the process

2023
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:22,960
of

2024
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:25,839
making and so it works very much the

2025
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:27,279
same way in terms of like

2026
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:30,080
the reading out the sequence but the

2027
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,600
nice thing about it is it's both

2028
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,880
quantitative and descriptive so rna

2029
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,960
sequencing can tell you the relative

2030
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,640
amounts like if there's a lot of a

2031
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,479
certain gene you know like oh there's

2032
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:41,439
like

2033
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:43,839
uh this is a rough like there's like on

2034
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:45,359
the order of a lot

2035
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:48,560
like 20 30 hundreds of this one

2036
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,479
mrna transcript it's expressing a lot of

2037
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:52,000
this gene versus very little

2038
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,158
of a different gene so you do get these

2039
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:55,520
quantitative readouts

2040
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,000
but you also get descriptive readouts so

2041
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,600
even if you hadn't sequenced

2042
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:02,560
the dna you can tell at this level if

2043
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:03,439
hey

2044
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:07,198
we know what um gene x is supposed to

2045
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:08,158
look like

2046
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:10,399
we can tell that this mrna is off it's

2047
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:13,198
been mutated in some way because the dna

2048
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:16,158
it's referencing has also been mutated

2049
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:17,679
and so at this level you can both

2050
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:20,479
characterize mutant

2051
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:22,319
instructions for making proteins but you

2052
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:24,640
can also quantify how much

2053
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,158
mrna is being produced like is it

2054
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:28,080
telling the cell to make a lot of a

2055
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:31,839
certain oncogene for example

2056
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,279
um and then sort of the last in this

2057
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:37,279
progression so we talked about dna

2058
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:39,679
rna and now we're talking about protein

2059
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:41,759
there are ways to quantify protein

2060
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:45,120
it is harder i would say than dna and

2061
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:45,679
rna

2062
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:47,679
dna and rna are nice in the sense that

2063
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:48,960
they are these like

2064
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:51,120
little linear molecules and they only

2065
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,040
have like four distinct options they

2066
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:53,759
either read

2067
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:57,040
you know atcg if your dna or

2068
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:00,480
a ucg if you're an rna and just knowing

2069
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:00,960
that they

2070
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,400
take on a certain shape and that they

2071
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,960
only have so many letters at a time

2072
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,560
makes it very easy to read and reference

2073
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:09,199
them

2074
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:11,760
and measure them protein is actually a

2075
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:12,400
lot harder

2076
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:15,440
right protein is like this physical 3d

2077
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:18,000
glob that takes on different shapes and

2078
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,760
so when we're trying to measure

2079
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,080
protein it's harder we can use things

2080
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,080
like mass spec where we try to look at

2081
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:24,480
the

2082
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,560
chemical composition basically of a

2083
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,239
protein

2084
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:30,400
or we can do things that are antibody

2085
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,520
based or

2086
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,480
probe based so we can for example

2087
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,840
engineer to like

2088
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:38,400
look at a particular protein that has a

2089
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,360
little light on it

2090
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,120
basically so it's like oh it lights up

2091
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,440
green versus it lights up blue

2092
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,679
or we could add antibodies which

2093
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:47,679
recognize the protein and they are

2094
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:49,760
basically the flag that says oh you know

2095
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,840
i added this antibody the antibody has a

2096
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,040
little red

2097
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:56,159
dot on it and it looks for protein x and

2098
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:56,719
so

2099
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:59,760
by proxy of how many antibodies i see

2100
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,360
binding that tells me how many of

2101
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,960
protein x i have

2102
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:06,000
so these are all very indirect measures

2103
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,920
um so measuring proteins tends to be a

2104
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,560
lot more difficult unfortunately

2105
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:13,040
but in some ways it's very impactful as

2106
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:13,760
i said

2107
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,760
this will tell us it could tell us what

2108
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,440
kinds of cells we have and it really

2109
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,120
does tell us directly what a cell is

2110
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,120
doing because proteins are what

2111
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,760
the action comes from in a cell so it's

2112
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,280
like one of the most important

2113
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,280
end stages of the process but it's also

2114
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,400
the hardest to quantify

2115
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,679
are there any questions about that

2116
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:39,040
all right um i just want to touch on two

2117
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,040
things which is that

2118
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,960
when we're looking at cancer there's

2119
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,080
lots of levels

2120
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,440
i think that's one of the hardest thing

2121
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,280
for a lot of students in cantor biology

2122
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,040
to unders to sort of wrap their mind

2123
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,640
around is that we move through these

2124
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,159
different levels of scale

2125
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:54,960
really interchangeably right there's

2126
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,880
like populations of people who get

2127
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:00,320
cancer there are you know cohorts who

2128
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,000
get certain types of cancers and have

2129
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,120
certain lifestyles

2130
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,040
and you zoom in on a patient and what

2131
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,400
the patient does

2132
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,400
then you zoom in on their tumor but

2133
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,480
their tumor is actually a collection of

2134
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,000
very different cells

2135
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,920
so then you zoom in on a particular type

2136
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,239
of cell you zoom in on the dna

2137
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:17,520
and we're like moving through all of

2138
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,600
these levels to talk about cancer as a

2139
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:20,000
whole

2140
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,440
which i think is the hard thing to

2141
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,840
navigate so everything i've talked about

2142
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,159
up until this point was sort of looking

2143
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:28,960
on a molecular level either at one

2144
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:31,199
particular cell or like all of the cells

2145
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:32,320
like mushed together

2146
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:35,280
into like an average but technically all

2147
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,159
of the cells

2148
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:38,000
are special right like if we're looking

2149
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,840
at a tumor

2150
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,520
the cells actually can be quite

2151
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,360
different from each other in terms of

2152
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,760
what their mutations have ended up being

2153
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,600
relative to each other

2154
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,920
and also what they're doing at a given

2155
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,120
time right

2156
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:52,480
so this picture here is just showing you

2157
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:54,719
like a tissue is like all of these cells

2158
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:56,000
collected together

2159
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,840
and actually when we look at a tumor it

2160
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,840
is incredibly heterogeneous right

2161
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:00,960
there's lots of different types of

2162
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,320
cancer cells there's actually

2163
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:05,040
normal cells kind of interwoven in

2164
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,159
they've either been

2165
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:08,000
recruited in or they're just sort of

2166
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,400
like bystanders in this process

2167
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,760
and so you can think of it as like when

2168
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,920
we're trying to take a sample and do dna

2169
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,199
sequencing we're actually just

2170
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:17,199
grabbing a whole bunch of these and just

2171
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:19,120
mashing them together to do the dna

2172
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:20,480
sequencing

2173
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:23,600
and so that adds to the noise it also

2174
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,760
just adds to the importance of trying to

2175
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:26,960
discern

2176
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,280
spatially what's happening right because

2177
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,560
these are actually all

2178
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,239
different like there's an architecture

2179
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:33,920
to all these things interacting

2180
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:35,920
and we just sort of fuzz that over by

2181
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,320
like taking a giant scoop of them

2182
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:41,120
and mashing them up and measuring them

2183
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:42,560
and so i just want to mention there is a

2184
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:44,159
lot of effort to try to

2185
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:47,840
look at them in their original site like

2186
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,960
what where do they sit relative to each

2187
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:51,679
other

2188
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:53,120
and this has been done for a long time

2189
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,960
so i talked a bit about histology where

2190
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,640
you just take a slice of a tissue and

2191
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:57,920
you look at it

2192
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,520
but in the past it's been very hard for

2193
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:01,360
them to look at more than one or two

2194
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:02,480
things at a time like they

2195
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:05,040
see the physical layout and they maybe

2196
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:05,520
could

2197
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,159
look at one or two proteins at a time

2198
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:09,679
but there's been a lot of effort to try

2199
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:10,320
to look at

2200
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:14,159
multiple things like proteins

2201
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:18,080
or rnas or types of dna

2202
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,480
in their current layout like so where do

2203
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,400
cells that are doing certain things

2204
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,640
sit relative to each other within a

2205
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,719
tumor and so that's an active area of

2206
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:28,080
interest is trying to be able to do

2207
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,840
those measurements but without

2208
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,920
extracting the cells and like pushing

2209
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,520
them all together because that just sort

2210
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,040
of fuzzes away

2211
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:39,199
a lot of the complexities of the system

2212
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:45,920
all right any questions

2213
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:48,800
all right so let's see let's go a little

2214
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,400
ahead i wanted to give an example

2215
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:54,159
of um a couple of these

2216
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:57,199
applications so i just want to say

2217
01:14:57,199 --> 01:14:58,800
lots of different types of data that

2218
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,480
we're collecting some of these i haven't

2219
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,159
even talked about

2220
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:04,000
trying to integrate them is really

2221
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,760
challenging like there's such different

2222
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,440
types of data measuring you know things

2223
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,120
that are related but different

2224
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,159
and there's a lot of people interested

2225
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:12,080
in putting that information together

2226
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:13,760
right to have a more complete picture

2227
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:14,800
but that is a very

2228
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,840
challenging thing to do um i will

2229
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:21,120
say that this obviously fuels diagnoses

2230
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:22,320
like better understanding

2231
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:23,920
what kinds of cancer are out there and

2232
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,520
which kind of cancer you have

2233
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,440
but obviously it also guides how we

2234
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,040
treat the cancer which we'll talk about

2235
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,520
next week

2236
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,040
all right so let's talk about examples

2237
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,199
in the world of diagnosis that have to

2238
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:36,880
do with machine learning so let's talk

2239
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:38,400
about discovering

2240
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,920
different types of cancer cells

2241
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:44,320
so i just want to mention that we do a

2242
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,000
lot of clustering

2243
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,520
based on markers in the sample so maybe

2244
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,600
we collect a lot of different

2245
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,400
dna profiles and we've done a lot of

2246
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,239
different work clustering to say oh

2247
01:15:56,239 --> 01:15:58,880
like it's not just lung cancer it's lung

2248
01:15:58,880 --> 01:15:59,760
cancer type

2249
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,360
abc based on their genetic profiles

2250
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,040
so we've done a lot of work in that area

2251
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,120
to sort of discern like

2252
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,600
it's not just one homogenous group

2253
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,120
there's lots of different types of lung

2254
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,480
cancer can we

2255
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,560
sort of de novo discover what those

2256
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,960
types are on the basis of their genetic

2257
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:17,840
differences or

2258
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:21,199
protein level differences

2259
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:22,320
but i just want to remind you that

2260
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,080
clustering could be performed on many

2261
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,679
levels you could cluster

2262
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:28,480
patients you could cluster tumors within

2263
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:29,679
patients some patients have

2264
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:32,400
multiple tumor samples if a patient has

2265
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:33,760
a metastasized cancer you could

2266
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:34,640
literally

2267
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:37,920
collect like three or four different

2268
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:40,719
tumor samples just from one patient like

2269
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:41,920
one from the left lung

2270
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,760
one from the right wrong one from the

2271
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,520
kidney one from a lymph node

2272
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:47,360
and so are you clustering the patient or

2273
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,960
are you clustering the tumors within a

2274
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,040
patient which is different

2275
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,719
or you could cluster the cells

2276
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:54,719
themselves which is an even smaller

2277
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:56,239
level of resolution

2278
01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:57,920
so we've done a ton of that and you can

2279
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,199
actually find in the literature that

2280
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:00,400
we've discerned different

2281
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:04,320
subtypes of breast cancer lung cancer

2282
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,000
this has been done in many different

2283
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
cancer big cancer

2284
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,440
types where we've realized there's

2285
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:11,199
actually a lot of diversity of subtypes

2286
01:17:11,199 --> 01:17:14,000
within that type

2287
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:16,239
i just want to give an example of

2288
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:18,480
discerning normal versus

2289
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:22,159
tumor um and so i just want to say that

2290
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:25,280
in general doctors are very well trained

2291
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:26,080
to be able

2292
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,640
to see when something is off right they

2293
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,320
can look at an image and say hey this

2294
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:30,719
mass

2295
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:34,159
is not what i've seen all the 50 000

2296
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:36,400
other lung images i've looked at like

2297
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,760
this is abnormal

2298
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:40,239
and so doctors are experts they're

2299
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:42,000
usually very good at that but there are

2300
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:42,560
definitely

2301
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:45,840
cases where experts differ right get a

2302
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,120
second opinion

2303
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,120
two experts who've seen different

2304
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:50,560
samples over their lifetime and are

2305
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,320
maybe sensitive to different features in

2306
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,960
the image might say different things

2307
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,800
and so this is where maybe machine

2308
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,320
learning could come in and either sort

2309
01:17:58,320 --> 01:17:58,640
of

2310
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,640
standardize the process maybe see

2311
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,239
something that humans

2312
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:05,280
miss but this is an opportunity i think

2313
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,120
certainly where we could

2314
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,880
bring in machine learning and just help

2315
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,960
this process like can we sort of

2316
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,360
learn from many many experts and sort of

2317
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:15,280
pile like pile all of their knowledge

2318
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:16,480
together to have a more

2319
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:19,040
accurate uh way of just looking at

2320
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,480
images and saying hey this is probably

2321
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:21,920
cancerous you should follow

2322
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,560
the biopsy versus it's probably nothing

2323
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,239
don't worry about it

2324
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:28,000
just because again humans are biased

2325
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,520
humans make mistakes

2326
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:33,120
could machine learning do it better

2327
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,280
and then here's a slightly longer

2328
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:36,719
example that i just want to give

2329
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:39,760
this actually came this kind of work

2330
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,320
comes out of my previous phd lab it

2331
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:44,000
wasn't my work but it was work done by a

2332
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,280
colleague of mine

2333
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:47,199
which is trying to again look at sort of

2334
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:48,320
the difference between

2335
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,400
normal versus tumor in patients and

2336
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,760
helping with the diagnosis

2337
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,320
but also relating those different types

2338
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,440
of tumors

2339
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:59,199
to how well they're likely to do

2340
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:02,400
so a lot of profiling these different

2341
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:03,360
patients again

2342
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,360
is trying to figure out like what

2343
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,520
subtype of cancer you have you have lung

2344
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:08,239
cancer

2345
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:10,800
we discover it you have the symptoms we

2346
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,560
diagnose you with lung cancer just based

2347
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:13,040
on

2348
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,440
the imaging and maybe a biopsy but if we

2349
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,159
measure

2350
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:18,880
flags like genetic flags or protein

2351
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,560
flags abc

2352
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:23,440
can we group you into type a versus type

2353
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:24,239
b

2354
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:27,679
and do those types do better or worse um

2355
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:29,280
maybe you have a more aggressive cancer

2356
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,880
and that guides us to then

2357
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:33,199
be more aggressive in how we treat

2358
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:34,800
versus something that we can maybe be a

2359
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:35,440
little more

2360
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:38,560
like wait and watch and see what happens

2361
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,480
so there's a lot of interest in doing

2362
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:42,400
that um i want to say

2363
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,800
i gave the example of uh is this lung

2364
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,560
cancer no this is not lung cancer i

2365
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:47,440
apologize

2366
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:50,560
um this is just showing you that

2367
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,640
we're developing our understanding of

2368
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:54,080
these different genetic markers and

2369
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,600
which ones are relevant

2370
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:58,000
in a given cancer and so this is just

2371
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,199
showing you that you know

2372
01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:01,679
back in 1987 we realized that there was

2373
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:02,800
this protein

2374
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,960
that is commonly mutated called k-ras

2375
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,480
and so we would just sort of stratify

2376
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:07,600
patients into

2377
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,440
do you have a k-ras mutation or do you

2378
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:10,719
not but then

2379
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:12,400
over time as we've discovered more

2380
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,560
genetic markers then we can sort of

2381
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,400
create more buckets and have a little

2382
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,400
bit more guided therapy right

2383
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,560
so then we discovered egfr and so the

2384
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:22,719
way we treat egfr patient

2385
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:24,480
versus a k-rest patient within lung

2386
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:25,840
cancer might be different

2387
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,840
and now we have way more buckets as

2388
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,280
we've gotten way more data

2389
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,040
you can see on the right we have so many

2390
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:33,120
different markers we can look for that

2391
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,880
guide how we diagnose and then how we

2392
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:37,199
treat

2393
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:41,199
so here's the example from my lab which

2394
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:41,600
was

2395
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,800
looking at pediatric patients who have a

2396
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,080
type of cancer

2397
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:49,040
that occurs in the blood and so this

2398
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,719
type of cancer you can take a bone

2399
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:52,320
marrow sample because bone marrow is

2400
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:52,639
where

2401
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:54,880
blood originates so a lot of the

2402
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:56,800
different blood types come out of

2403
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,199
precursor cells in the bone marrow and

2404
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:00,880
so you could take a sample of that bone

2405
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,639
marrow and basically see

2406
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:04,560
what are the kinds of cells that are in

2407
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:05,760
a patient's

2408
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,520
bone marrow especially if they have

2409
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:09,600
cancer and what

2410
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,000
this researcher did is they basically

2411
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:12,960
were looking at

2412
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,360
samples they had ability to like kind of

2413
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:17,280
look at the different types of cells

2414
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,520
in different patients bone marrow so you

2415
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:20,480
can imagine they took

2416
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,480
maybe my bone marrow and ed's bone

2417
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,000
marrow and they can basically discern

2418
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,080
like oh how much of each type of cell

2419
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,400
do you have and do these cells look

2420
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,239
normal or do these cells look

2421
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:33,040
abnormal and so they basically created a

2422
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:34,719
spectrum of like

2423
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:37,679
how much of each type of cell do you

2424
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:38,400
have

2425
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,400
does it look more abnormal does it look

2426
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:41,600
more normal

2427
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,679
and what they did is they related that

2428
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:45,440
like the amount of each type of cell and

2429
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:47,280
how normal it looks or have normal

2430
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,760
how abnormal it looks they related that

2431
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,840
to whether that patient would ultimately

2432
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:55,440
relapse or not so they basically know

2433
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,760
of their sample how many patients had a

2434
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,600
more aggressive cancer had a cancer that

2435
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,840
was ultimately resistant to therapy

2436
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:05,199
versus patients who responded well

2437
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:06,960
and they wanted to figure out what is

2438
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,120
special about those patients who tended

2439
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:10,480
to relapse

2440
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:13,040
so if we know that ahead of time we can

2441
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,639
be more aggressive in how we treat their

2442
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:16,000
cancer we know that they

2443
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,679
we need to be careful with that patient

2444
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:19,280
because they're very likely

2445
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,920
to not do as well and so they basically

2446
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:22,400
went in

2447
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:25,040
and tried to learn the features that

2448
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,400
distinguished

2449
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,320
patients who relapse from patients who

2450
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,320
do not read lips and they were basically

2451
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,840
able to figure out

2452
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,000
hey there's sort of this signature of

2453
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,760
like things happening

2454
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,239
in certain cells that is unique to the

2455
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:40,560
patients who tend to relapse

2456
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:41,840
and that can actually guide them to

2457
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:43,760
think about okay those

2458
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:46,239
that profile those things that are

2459
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:47,280
different about the

2460
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,679
patients who relapse can we target those

2461
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:51,440
ahead of time so that they're less

2462
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:52,800
likely to relapse

2463
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,560
and basically preempt what we've

2464
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:57,199
observed will tend to happen

2465
01:22:57,199 --> 01:22:59,920
so i'm happy i just realized that the

2466
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,840
reference to this paper is not in my

2467
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:02,639
slides

2468
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:04,719
i'm happy to add that in for next time

2469
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:06,159
just that you're able to look up this

2470
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:08,639
paper if that interests you

2471
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:10,239
all right in the few minutes i have left

2472
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:12,159
i just want to call attention to

2473
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:14,080
the challenges in this area so i've

2474
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:16,639
highlighted some more success stories

2475
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:17,679
but what is so

2476
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:20,560
hard about machine learning in biology

2477
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,800
and in cancer specifically

2478
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,159
so i want to say a couple of the

2479
01:23:24,159 --> 01:23:26,320
problems are very technical and a couple

2480
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,480
of problems are not very technical so

2481
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:29,920
the number one problem i actually bring

2482
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,280
up is not technical at all

2483
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:33,520
it actually has to do with crossing

2484
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:34,639
disciplines

2485
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:36,400
it's been very challenging when there's

2486
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:37,920
people who've been uh

2487
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,920
traditionally trained in like computer

2488
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:41,440
science and algorithms

2489
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,880
and then people who've been trained in

2490
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,960
the wet lab biology and they know

2491
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:47,120
how these measurements work having them

2492
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:48,159
talk together and

2493
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:51,199
design a study that is rigorous and

2494
01:23:51,199 --> 01:23:52,719
sound has been challenging because they

2495
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:54,560
don't understand the limitations on both

2496
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:55,679
sides

2497
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:57,280
i've dealt with people who don't

2498
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:59,760
understand how rna sequencing works and

2499
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:01,280
so when i tell them hey it's this

2500
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:02,880
average of all this mush they're

2501
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:05,040
surprised they're like oh can't you

2502
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,440
get out who contributed what and there

2503
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:08,960
are some ways that you can kind of do

2504
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:09,520
that

2505
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,120
but fundamentally you're just mushing

2506
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:12,880
the cells all together like method

2507
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:15,440
wise it's an average and that's been

2508
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:16,800
something they weren't aware of and

2509
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,239
other people who don't understand the

2510
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:19,360
algorithms

2511
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:21,679
might assume that you can back solve

2512
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:23,199
things that you can't

2513
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:25,040
so that's one inherent problem in this

2514
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,719
field is just the the

2515
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:29,120
siloed off disciplines and the lack of

2516
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:30,719
communication

2517
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:32,400
but there are a lot of other issues i

2518
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,639
mentioned noisy data

2519
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:36,960
huge variability within the data like

2520
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,719
you can have two lung cancer patients

2521
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:39,440
who actually

2522
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,280
despite both having lung cancer seem

2523
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:43,120
incredibly different from each other and

2524
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,159
their pathology

2525
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:47,920
and what their tumors say i did mention

2526
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:48,719
the idea of

2527
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:50,639
integrating multiple types of data it's

2528
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:52,400
very hard to bring together the

2529
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,639
mutational profile and what the dna says

2530
01:24:54,639 --> 01:24:56,560
and what the protein says and make them

2531
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,560
sort of work together to have one

2532
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,080
picture

2533
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:02,400
um i will also say that it's very tough

2534
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:03,679
these days i think you might have heard

2535
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:05,920
of this idea of personalized medicine

2536
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,520
but if you think about it in terms of

2537
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:09,360
how you would go about

2538
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:12,639
setting up a machine learning problem

2539
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:14,560
the more sample the better and so when

2540
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,159
we're emphasizing hey personalized

2541
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:16,880
medicine

2542
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:19,760
have an n of one that starts to fly in

2543
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:21,920
the face of the statistical rigor we

2544
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:22,800
need to back

2545
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:25,760
up what we're finding um so i think i

2546
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:26,000
will

2547
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,400
leave it at that i have these slides i

2548
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:29,360
think

2549
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:30,719
uh ed you might have these slides

2550
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:32,880
already uploaded if not i'll send you

2551
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,040
this is a slightly updated set um i

2552
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,639
mostly actually took away things rather

2553
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:37,840
than adding things

2554
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,679
i'll send the updated set but i think i

2555
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:41,360
will leave it off there and i'll just

2556
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:42,800
say that next week we're going to really

2557
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:43,679
focus on

2558
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:45,520
okay we can figure out these different

2559
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,600
cancer subtypes but how do we discern

2560
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,679
how to treat these different patients

2561
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:51,199
and use

2562
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:54,480
ai to do so better okay thank you so

2563
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:55,760
much melissa

2564
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:59,840
any questions questions from students

2565
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:04,800
we'll have plenty of time also next time

2566
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,639
for questions i think so you can leave

2567
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:08,800
your question on slack so next time when

2568
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,239
melissa comes back

2569
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:12,719
and she can answer your questions

2570
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:13,440
awesome

2571
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:15,679
thank you so much everyone yeah so much

2572
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:17,040
thank you so much

2573
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:19,040
looking forward to seeing you again and

2574
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:20,719
remind the students

2575
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:22,880
your proposal is due the project

2576
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:23,760
proposal is due

2577
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:26,719
tonight if you need more time just let

2578
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:27,760
us know

2579
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:31,760
and the next tuesday i look forward to

2580
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:34,639
your presentation on your proposals and

2581
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:36,960
sahil please try to organize

2582
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,360
uh the discussion next tuesday and i

2583
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,199
will come back to see malissa again on

2584
01:26:41,199 --> 01:26:42,400
