00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,880
welcome again to cs 372

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,719
this is the final

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,360
lecture of this quarter

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,160
and

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,600
before the lecture i did a survey asking

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,119
what topics now will be of your interest

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,279
and use suggested i should cover privacy

8
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,160
preserving machine learning

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,119
and i think i agree because privacy

10
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,479
preservation

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,600
is an important topic and you must heard

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,320
about gdpr this is the european

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,840
privacy act

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,120
and in the medical domain we have had

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,520
gpa for some years

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,000
and the california last year passed and

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,600
also put into practice ccpa

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,079
and one important element is

19
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,520
and not only

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,640
you want to allow user to do

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,960
explicit up in

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,959
and up out certain items right

23
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,040
and you have to be able to prove

24
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,799
you have done so

25
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,360
and a lot of time a company can just say

26
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,799
yes this is the policy we have we have

27
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,000
informed

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,280
the users and yes they can press the

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,520
button to open up about

30
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,759
but you have no idea what's really

31
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:24,799
behind

32
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,920
the screen so the key is

33
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,640
must be verifiable and then you need to

34
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,360
the company to prove to in the court

35
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,680
they really have done what they have

36
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,040
promised

37
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,119
so the details will be covered in

38
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,040
today's lecture

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,159
and let me make two announcements

40
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,280
and our final project presentation we

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,000
have uh scheduled beyond the stack

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,840
select channel and make sure you are

43
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,320
present on this wednesday and

44
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,159
i'm looking forward to

45
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,759
a wonderful presentation of yours

46
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:02,799
and

47
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,159
regarding

48
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,560
a project suggestion

49
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,439
put

50
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,080
all our electric material together to

51
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,000
develop a caring agent for example we do

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,120
health care caring for elderly

53
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,440
in the nursing home and building a robot

54
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,440
using the technologies we cover like

55
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,959
virtual assistant

56
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,920
by making the dialogue between a patient

57
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,360
and a caregiver

58
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,480
a really

59
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,400
caring as we said

60
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,879
lobbying means you make

61
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,000
another person a better version of him

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,080
or herself

63
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,959
and i would put materials together

64
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,519
and we can work on this interesting

65
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,560
project

66
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,239
as an optional

67
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,040
project in the summer

68
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,200
and now let me project

69
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,840
the slides of today and let's get

70
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,400
started

71
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,840
okay today's outline we are going to

72
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,480
start cover the major concerns about

73
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,280
privacy from users perspective and also

74
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,159
from

75
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,159
companies perspectives

76
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,080
and the privacy regulations the key

77
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,560
regulations are ccpa and gdpr and we

78
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,599
plan to explain them in details

79
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,680
and also in the medical domain right we

80
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,879
have we have

81
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,879
another set of regulations

82
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,599
but they are pretty similar

83
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,640
then from these compliance requirements

84
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,440
if we cannot comply as a company the

85
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,319
company may be fined heavily so we have

86
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,799
to understand the complex requirement

87
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,959
and convert the requirement into

88
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,799
execution requirements

89
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,720
and we must have heard about

90
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,000
like federated learning or differential

91
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,959
learning

92
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,080
will those

93
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,560
implementation fulfill the regulation

94
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,080
requirements or not

95
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,840
i personally consider they are not

96
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,959
adequate

97
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,760
but it's really hard to say until

98
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,680
the company and

99
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,519
was a company will be brought to the

100
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,239
lawsuit situation the court eventually

101
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,080
will clarify

102
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,560
the boundary of the regulations

103
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,680
so we enumerate three major technical

104
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,879
approaches

105
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,279
to be able to preserve privacy

106
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,600
and finally uh i mentioned is the

107
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,400
standard system called saltaria it's

108
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,000
called developed by

109
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,680
by stanford and also my previous

110
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,800
colleagues

111
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,479
and use this blockchain

112
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,919
to safeguarding privacy

113
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,240
so privacy for sure we know that they

114
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,639
said using cell phone using laptop

115
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,600
whatever information we enter

116
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,080
we will be tracked right so there's a

117
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
trade-off between free usage

118
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,000
applications and you have to give us

119
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,960
something

120
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,199
and in certain situations

121
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,800
if you don't give up your information

122
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,479
the application cannot be run like

123
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,560
google maps right google maps you say i

124
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,560
want to about

125
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,520
location tracking then good luck

126
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,800
it just cannot be functioning so but

127
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,840
other applications like news so i i'm

128
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,320
consulting a japanese company right now

129
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,479
and they are worried about if they track

130
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,360
your reading patterns uh what will be

131
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,800
the regulation ramifications right so in

132
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,039
certain applications the

133
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,039
yes or no between yes or no the

134
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,360
boundaries is kind of tricky

135
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,560
and the sale giant vehicle for sure

136
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,160
he has been collecting tons of data and

137
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,400
take tesla as an example if you see the

138
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,960
fine print behind the vehicle you can

139
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,199
see uh it collects your

140
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,919
battery status temperature inside

141
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,000
outside your location

142
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,560
also in this level two

143
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,720
cell driving they have to track the

144
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,759
user's status right if a user is dozing

145
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,560
off

146
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,199
they quickly they will just turn off

147
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,800
self-driving mode

148
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,960
and all those information potentially

149
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,520
where you are and what is your

150
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,240
conversation even in the car uh they

151
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,039
will track and for instance if you are

152
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,360
in they say in some countries you get

153
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,199
into a taxi and everything uh you you

154
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,000
kind of conduct in that tennessee

155
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,440
in that space

156
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,560
uh

157
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,800
it's not personal information it's

158
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,600
actually private and so when we talk

159
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,840
about health care we introduce this

160
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,960
tricorder device with the number of

161
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,639
medical iots

162
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,440
and all those information such as

163
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,639
the

164
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,080
walking pattern and the the ecg

165
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,120
information on apple watch right those

166
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,240
data

167
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,360
is being collected and utilized

168
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,000
and uh frankly i have no idea who is

169
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,520
using my

170
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,160
ecg data and will

171
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,280
apple

172
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,199
resell my data to

173
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,720
other companies

174
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,360
at this point i'm just totally clueless

175
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,319
right so it would be nice to be informed

176
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,919
what kind of data is being collected

177
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:02,960
from me

178
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,240
and

179
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,160
to to which party the data will be sold

180
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,120
and

181
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,680
although as part of stanford over we're

182
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,919
doing this virtual system and virtual

183
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,479
system will become more and more popular

184
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,560
even you don't have a speaker just talk

185
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,360
to

186
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,840
your computer through siri

187
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,160
information is being collected and all

188
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,840
these speakers

189
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,319
suppose we turn them off they are still

190
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,000
sort of listening right because they

191
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,120
need to be be waken up to perform their

192
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,160
duties

193
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,039
so conversations at home uh will be

194
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,759
recorded so one situation i got into

195
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,960
this was about a week ago i went up to

196
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,639
the dish and i came home and i i feel i

197
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,120
feel my knees were hurting

198
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,039
so i i on the one hand i'm searching for

199
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,039
remedies for uh

200
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,560
hitting my knees

201
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,919
at the same time i also talked to my

202
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,680
wife about the situation

203
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,879
and suddenly facebook uh prompt this

204
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,840
video to me so that was very spooky

205
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,639
right uh so this could be one of two

206
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,240
situations one was

207
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,879
facebook sue uh

208
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:13,919
macbook

209
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,520
was listening to me

210
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
and the second thing is maybe i was

211
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,840
typing something in real time the

212
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,599
information was transmitted to facebook

213
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,840
and facebook do this kind of real-time

214
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,960
matching

215
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,879
so this is uh to me it's a kind of

216
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,520
horrible experience means well in real

217
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,479
time people can target me uh

218
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,240
or you can say this is a blessing i have

219
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,880
this health health concern and someone

220
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,000
is really caring for me

221
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,880
so

222
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,279
top consumer privacy concerns so yes i

223
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,040
do have a lot of concerns this is a

224
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,040
survey uh conducted by uh some agencies

225
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,880
and you can search all these kind of

226
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,880
different surveys on the internet so i

227
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,800
summarized some key concerns one is

228
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,399
definitely identity

229
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,240
theft

230
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,959
it's not really changing these days even

231
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,240
you say i want to anonymize myself

232
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,440
but still

233
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,760
do cross-court correlation

234
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,240
uh the if people really want to target

235
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,680
you individually

236
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,360
they could get your

237
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,839
pi information personal identifying the

238
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,040
information

239
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,440
and the private data then will be made

240
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,200
public and this is

241
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,480
really bad for especially politicians

242
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,600
even for us right it's not a glamorous

243
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,920
government glimmer situation

244
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,000
and data can be sold and distributed

245
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,160
without our knowledge and certain data

246
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,080
especially medical data could be

247
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,600
valuable so when data been sold uh

248
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,440
people will be willing to sell the data

249
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,480
for revenue or for charity but they'd

250
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,160
like to know

251
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,399
the fact the data has been used

252
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,120
and the safety if my location can always

253
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,480
be tracked

254
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,839
then if people want to uh impose harm

255
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,440
to myself and that that's kind of

256
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,360
not a converting situation so let's

257
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,120
enumerate some details of ccpa and the

258
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,720
gdpr regulations so gdpr

259
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,720
was established by

260
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,600
european union and ccpa was passed by

261
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,519
california congress

262
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,399
uh about two years ago then the was

263
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,000
become active

264
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,240
january

265
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,800
2020

266
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,600
and they gave all the companies some

267
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,320
great spirit to implement it

268
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,720
and currently as i

269
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,440
if if my information is not obsolete

270
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,000
means if a consumer asks for certain

271
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,920
privacy related actions

272
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,680
uh to be conducted by a company let's

273
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,959
say erase my ss history the company has

274
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,920
to respond in about three months

275
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,800
so

276
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,279
because the regulation was just uh was

277
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,279
just out there last year so therefore

278
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,640
they gave this long grace period for all

279
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,760
the companies to get their ad together

280
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,160
and recently

281
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,480
when you access certain sites you

282
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,120
started to get a pop-up like can i use

283
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,720
your cookie can i track your cookie and

284
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,200
so on so forth those are pretty much

285
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,360
because of a ccpa

286
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,560
and

287
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,519
lawyers agree ccpa although was

288
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,920
initiated in california but will be

289
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,440
widely adopted by other states very very

290
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,959
soon

291
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,480
so like i mentioned

292
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,600
ccpa started last year

293
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,760
and some terms let's

294
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,399
define them so when we discuss all the

295
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,640
implementations we will be on the same

296
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,640
page so here we say person person we

297
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,720
talk about uh

298
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,680
juris prudence uh nature person just

299
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,800
like

300
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,040
the person with with the body

301
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,440
with temperature right it's not like a

302
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,480
business business kind of unit

303
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,440
so

304
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,360
personal information

305
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,240
defined by information that can identify

306
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,120
or relates to describes

307
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,959
is reasonable capable of being

308
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,560
associated with

309
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,160
a real person okay so this

310
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,760
kind of personal information could

311
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,560
include my address

312
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,680
ids

313
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,639
and

314
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,040
several other things and we talk about

315
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,160
more in later slides

316
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,279
and then

317
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,399
to

318
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,639
store the data imagine data

319
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,760
we divide the people into uh kind of

320
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,160
three two or three categories one is the

321
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,160
people need to match data right data we

322
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,839
call data subject

323
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,320
and the data controller

324
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,120
is a person who determines the process

325
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,000
of managing the data and set up the sop

326
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,920
standard operation process for

327
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,120
processing data and data processors

328
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,120
are the people who are instructed by

329
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,519
data controllers to process the data so

330
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,279
basically you have controller and

331
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,480
processor they play different roles

332
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,680
okay

333
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,519
and the

334
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,880
pi personal information is divided by

335
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,839
a few categories one is personal

336
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,160
information strictly prohibited to

337
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,120
disclose including a person's religion

338
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,600
genetics biometric

339
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,800
health healthcare data and ids

340
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,839
and there there are more

341
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,600
and some data

342
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,440
they are anonymized

343
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,639
right so suppose you have a database

344
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,560
storing a person's name

345
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,839
and then all the personal information

346
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,720
plus their access history ss means i say

347
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,800
i access a news

348
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,519
website the access history will be all

349
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,839
the news i have read in the last let's

350
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,680
say several weeks

351
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,320
so you like to be able to anonymize

352
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,760
not really the assets patterns but my pi

353
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,279
personal information need to be

354
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,959
anonymized

355
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,360
and another category is pseudo

356
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,839
anonymized so even let's say you

357
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,120
anonymize

358
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,760
my record but still

359
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,199
using some mechanisms i can still

360
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,079
re-engineering or re-identify identify

361
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,360
that person right i will give an example

362
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,279
shortly so basically suppose i have your

363
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,480
address

364
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,519
and

365
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,680
that's very very simple i have your

366
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,440
gender and maybe your working location

367
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,720
maybe it's not too hard to pin down

368
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,600
your identity even not yourself per se

369
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,320
but can profile you into a specific

370
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,240
group

371
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,360
so

372
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,839
this is a example

373
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,519
suppose you have

374
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,959
data stored

375
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,519
by let's say facebook or google

376
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,519
and they need to worry about two things

377
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,240
one is how to store data

378
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,199
and

379
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,440
the second thing is how the data will be

380
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,800
accessed right and the storage because

381
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,959
when you store data data will be used so

382
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,959
how the data gets stored can affect

383
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,079
privacy

384
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,199
so let's say you have your

385
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,800
database table

386
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,480
which consists of

387
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,680
personal

388
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,560
information and like i mentioned some ss

389
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,120
history you have to separate the two

390
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,639
into two tables and do it to a join

391
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,639
and the only data controller can see

392
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,160
both tables and the data processor

393
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,240
can only touch on

394
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,440
the table with only data data history

395
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,240
but without bi information okay so you

396
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,079
kind of reduce the

397
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,440
number of people who can touch the pi

398
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,800
information

399
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,240
and oh

400
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,720
even let's say data controller can

401
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,440
access pi information and all the

402
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,240
accesses must be logged

403
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,279
and logged on indebtable record for

404
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,199
future audit

405
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,720
so here one important point uh sticks

406
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,600
out is indelible record

407
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,120
for audit

408
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,680
and the auditing process must be

409
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,120
transparent

410
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,639
and must be

411
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,720
trusted and all the actions done by this

412
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,160
dc

413
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,839
and also

414
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,240
need to be provable right so you say

415
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,720
yeah i did it i did this and that but

416
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,120
that's your verbal cleanse

417
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,320
but when fcc audits a company they want

418
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,360
to see

419
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,800
provable evidence

420
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,720
so privacy

421
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,360
governance and the

422
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,120
policy

423
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,360
clearly returned to cover the following

424
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,480
so i will talk about

425
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,440
gdpr and ccpa separately but they are

426
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,120
very similar

427
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,600
only about one or two items

428
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,320
they are they have slight differences

429
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,920
so the policy clearly written

430
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,680
just sent to the user user need to

431
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,560
consent the policy has to cover

432
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,959
what data the site

433
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,880
collects from the user

434
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,839
and the collection method mechanism how

435
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,439
data will be used

436
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,480
and what the user will receive as an

437
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,839
exchange right so for example your you

438
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,280
would give

439
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,640
more accurate ads as an exchange whether

440
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,000
you like it or not you can make a

441
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,039
decision

442
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:25,839
and

443
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,000
where the data has been stored

444
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,840
and where the data be shared and share

445
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,160
with them so this required information

446
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,559
must be stated in in the privacy policy

447
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,360
and

448
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,840
some consent must be

449
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,440
is pleasingly given by the data subject

450
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,520
and you cannot say i give you this

451
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,480
policy with 10 items

452
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,240
and then you say well you have to agree

453
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,039
with either or or nothing

454
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,440
so the key thing here is that by default

455
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,559
all the items will be opt out

456
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,200
and we have to itemize each collected

457
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,200
data item separately

458
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,480
and then there's no bundle agreement and

459
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,360
the user has to to click each one of

460
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,320
them to say yeah either i accept your

461
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,720
collection of my data collecting my data

462
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,799
or not right so

463
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,080
no box

464
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,600
can be pre-checked and the option is up

465
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,400
out

466
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,360
and the user can come in to select the

467
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,240
items they feel comfortable about and

468
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,640
they can always come back to

469
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,480
about okay

470
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,480
so everything has to be done explicitly

471
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,600
that's the key so unlike currently

472
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,240
many many consumer activities you will

473
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,360
be given a huge or

474
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,160
a huge huge deck of documents and you

475
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,080
you are required to sign to finish

476
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,799
signing within 10 or 20 minutes right

477
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,559
especially let's say you

478
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,760
buy a house or you can even buy a car

479
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,919
and the contract agreement

480
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,520
a few pages and you just cannot see all

481
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,480
the details of or fine prints

482
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,679
within

483
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,400
the the pressure timing

484
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,039
okay the second uh

485
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,480
information pieces specifically cover

486
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,080
gdpr it's european regulations and the

487
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,799
consumer has right to

488
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,520
kind of inform right any data

489
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,400
being assets must be

490
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,600
be told and the right of assets must be

491
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,000
granted by the user and right the user

492
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,720
has right to erase to be forgotten and

493
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,960
right of data probability if i want to

494
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,600
move my data from hospital a to hospital

495
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,640
b b you you cannot say no you have to

496
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,640
let me do it right to restrict data

497
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,840
processing and write to object and data

498
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,200
processing can you you can you can even

499
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,679
be very specific saying okay my gender

500
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,559
information or my age information

501
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,720
should not be revealed

502
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,559
right to

503
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,799
rectification it means i can make

504
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,280
changes to my personal information and

505
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,520
right to reject automated individual

506
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,880
decision making or profiling or even as

507
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,039
targeting

508
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,640
and ccpa

509
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,240
as i said

510
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,120
the

511
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,600
b of rights are very similar to gdpr

512
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,480
except for two items so i highlight in

513
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,600
in red

514
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,000
the first here is know whether their

515
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,120
personal data is sold or disclosed and

516
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,360
if so to whom okay and gdpr didn't say

517
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,159
not specifically but ccpa is saying well

518
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,960
if your data has been sold you have to

519
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,840
tell the the owner it's basically and

520
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,400
this is probably because of the the a

521
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,159
few problems happen

522
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,880
in in the past years and i have

523
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,640
some examples to show you uh shortly

524
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,880
and the final one is it's a little bit

525
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,400
dicey it's got

526
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,760
not to be

527
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,360
discriminated

528
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,320
and i couldn't understand it until uh

529
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,039
the the company's smart news and try to

530
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,640
implement the privacy

531
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,640
rules so

532
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,440
so smart news in the usually say well

533
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,720
our privacy data stored in the backend

534
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,559
is very convoluted

535
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,520
so if we really need to be in compliance

536
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,200
then we have to

537
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,600
redesign the database schemas we have to

538
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,120
do this data

539
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,880
downloading reloading this will take

540
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,320
some time so why don't we do a shortcut

541
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,039
we just tell the users who

542
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,919
up out this kind of access

543
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,600
data agreement we just say okay sorry

544
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,080
you cannot use our application anymore

545
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,159
and they basically install them they

546
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,919
install their applications from their

547
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,840
phone or from your desktop

548
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,120
and from ccps percent perspective you

549
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,039
cannot do that because this means you

550
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,120
are discriminating certain

551
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,360
users they are not waiting

552
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,760
to let you collect their data

553
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,480
but why this is very kind of dicey

554
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,720
because suppose uh

555
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,480
in the situation of

556
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,960
google maps right so you say okay i'm

557
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,280
not going to allow you to track my

558
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,720
location so you say oh then i cannot

559
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,520
give you a driving direction

560
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,679
that's not really discriminating against

561
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,080
you that's i cannot serve you because i

562
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,760
don't have certain information about

563
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,480
your

564
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,960
your situation there's no way i can give

565
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,000
you a reasonable prediction of your of

566
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,480
your next driving uh direction so

567
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,240
another scenario you can say the

568
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,480
opposite let's say i have this

569
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,200
application i want to charge you for

570
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,240
let's say subscription fee 10

571
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,520
a month

572
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,640
but if you allow me to access your data

573
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,240
then it's free

574
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,960
so then then this if you if you have

575
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,600
this kind of kind of over

576
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,039
it's hard to say whether you are

577
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,440
discriminating against a user or not

578
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,080
right so all these kind of boundary

579
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,880
conditions uh we can interpret right now

580
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,520
but eventually will be interpreted by

581
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,799
the law of

582
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,679
the core of the law

583
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,520
so finally a very subtle point but it's

584
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,799
extremely critical is i'm not going to

585
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,880
read redesign all details the critical

586
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,760
thing is you have to be able to

587
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,240
write all your privacy safeguarding

588
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,440
actions

589
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,720
somewhere

590
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,400
and eventually

591
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,520
your actions have to be provable

592
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,640
so give you example this a person x

593
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,000
requested company y to erase is or

594
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,320
probably consent via email

595
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,400
and companywide did not fulfill the

596
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,880
request and but claim they claim that

597
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,159
they have done the request right so you

598
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,159
say okay you raise my data i say oh i

599
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,120
did it but i actually did not so how can

600
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,679
you prove it and you can get into this

601
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,720
uh he says she say situation that would

602
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,799
be very convoluted

603
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,400
so the law requires

604
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,200
the company has to be able to prove

605
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,840
they have done all the processes to

606
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,720
safeguarding the user's privacy so let's

607
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,120
come back and talk about probability

608
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,840
in the end

609
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,360
and these are some landmark cases of

610
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,320
privacy positive violation

611
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,240
and the consequences

612
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,159
on the top row

613
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,120
you see in the beginning or

614
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,039
maybe a couple of years ago

615
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,919
uber was fined for 148 million by eu so

616
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,120
the top line was a violation of

617
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,480
gdpr

618
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,799
and then there was a

619
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,039
230 million dollars fine

620
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,000
uh

621
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,880
from british airway

622
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,799
and the most recent one was ftc

623
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,440
versus facebook and facebook was fined

624
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,360
by five billion

625
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,960
dollars

626
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,000
and the

627
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,720
the bottom is of course is the case

628
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,400
happened just last year

629
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,640
uh ftc

630
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,559
brought a lawsuit against

631
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,679
google youtube and google youtube did

632
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,600
not send consent

633
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,880
to children's parent for accessing

634
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,960
children's data right so this is also

635
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,760
kind of complicated because for minors

636
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,480
uh they don't have even they say well i

637
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,440
agree you collect my data but they don't

638
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,799
really have they do they don't have a

639
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,960
sufficient uh ability to make such a

640
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,120
judgment so the consent should be sent

641
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,720
to parents

642
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,240
then this was google was flying by 170

643
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,159
million dollars

644
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,840
so a very

645
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,039
uh tricky situation here was

646
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,440
some company they would say okay i get

647
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,880
fined by

648
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,640
ftc or some agencies for millions of

649
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,919
dollars

650
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,600
but on the other hand

651
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,559
because of the information i can earn

652
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,559
billions of dollars

653
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:07,360
so

654
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,600
for some companies they will say

655
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,720
well

656
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,120
this is cost of sales

657
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,159
i don't know whether you have heard

658
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,039
about this term or not um like one

659
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,159
example i can provide is

660
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,279
like

661
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,679
google use page rank in the beginning

662
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,320
and then they do this

663
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,120
adwords right if you you can buy words

664
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,640
on search terms on google

665
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,919
and the patents of adwords was owned by

666
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,679
the european company

667
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,039
so if you

668
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,440
implement it without licensing then

669
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,840
you'll be fined heavily

670
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,000
but if you

671
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,400
want to license it and there's a cost so

672
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,080
how can you deal with the situation

673
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,440
right so that's

674
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,039
when that happens that's a consideration

675
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,440
i'll say yeah let me let me just violate

676
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,159
it

677
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,760
if uh

678
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,240
it's not working then i just uh during

679
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,200
this kind of disagreement or dispute i

680
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,240
can just drop it but if i make huge

681
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,480
profit about it then i i can just pay

682
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,039
the fine because at the end i'm earning

683
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,799
more than then

684
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,400
my my loss

685
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,120
so that was very uh that kind of act was

686
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,919
very

687
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,520
not ethical but

688
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,320
it's it's actually in practice

689
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,200
okay

690
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,200
now we want to say you talk about all

691
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,440
these compliance requirements how can we

692
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,480
implement it and be very careful

693
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,559
there are many methods presented out

694
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:33,520
there

695
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,240
but os on mine is one

696
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,080
even the policy has been implemented

697
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,960
can private private information still

698
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,360
be

699
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,880
re-identified or

700
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,279
people can do reverse engineer to find

701
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,360
out who you are or which group you

702
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,840
belong to right so that's one thing to

703
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,320
consider the second thing to consider is

704
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,559
again the probability

705
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,279
and trust right so you say you had done

706
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,480
that but

707
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,000
prove me

708
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
how did you do it and when did you do it

709
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:08,880
so

710
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,720
the execution to comply consists of uh

711
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,000
five steps

712
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,679
one is you have to delegate an oversight

713
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,000
committee in a company

714
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,240
so this is just not saying say i have

715
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,919
done that so when ftc orders a company

716
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,399
my previous company was audited by

717
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,000
ftc so when they came in they say hey

718
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,480
give me all the documents to show you do

719
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,640
have oversight committee who they are

720
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,000
and these people do exist okay

721
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,799
and

722
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,880
they they map the data you have

723
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,640
collected to

724
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,200
your usage and storage so where do you

725
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,240
store data can you show us the document

726
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,159
and how the data has been used so it's

727
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,399
definitely hard for fftc to really get

728
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,640
into your database to look around but

729
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,720
they want to see documentations

730
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,960
and then do you have this sop

731
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,960
for your employees

732
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,279
right so all the regulation we talked

733
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,080
about

734
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,200
do you have this compliance process for

735
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,240
your data controller and also data

736
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,520
processors if frankly you don't even

737
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,840
have a process in place then everything

738
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,360
is just talking

739
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,919
and do you have your personnel divided

740
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:24,840
into

741
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,640
dc and the dp and also specifying their

742
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,279
roles very clearly right

743
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,080
and

744
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,360
sop for serving consumers when consumers

745
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,320
is served did you really give them

746
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,640
this kind of contract to sign so allow

747
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,279
them to operate and about and comply

748
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,240
with all these required items and

749
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,520
finally probability

750
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,559
uh let's look at the technique technical

751
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:53,679
approaches

752
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,399
so the first one is very

753
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,720
uh understandable you say i just

754
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,640
anonymize the data right then we have

755
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,000
this differential privacy was popular

756
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,960
before cc ccpa

757
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,919
was activated and the federated learning

758
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,960
is still very popular and google was was

759
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,840
pushing that uh pushing this back this

760
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,320
is effort and quite a few papers have

761
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,720
been published uh on this particular

762
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,360
subject then finally talk about

763
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,120
distributed ledgers

764
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,159
so

765
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,559
anonymize versus pseudo

766
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,399
anonymization

767
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,960
there are some subtle differences so

768
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,919
anonymization means if i even i look at

769
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,279
the the data or a sql table i have no

770
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,480
idea who is that particular person so

771
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,600
basically just hide all the personal

772
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,320
identifiable information right so

773
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,640
including a cell already your gender

774
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,039
your profession and so on so forth

775
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,399
so but

776
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,600
even let's say data has been anonymized

777
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,039
uh still

778
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,159
could be re-engineered to find out who

779
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,640
is a person for instance

780
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,120
let's say cell phone will track

781
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,720
my locations so he knows in the day time

782
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,480
i will be in certain locations around

783
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,399
stanford so

784
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,880
for sure i think

785
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,679
the google maps or say oh edward

786
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,240
is affiliated with stanford university

787
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,760
and he lives in palato right and

788
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,919
from the duration i

789
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,880
stay in a particular location they say i

790
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,440
stay in the gates building but

791
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,240
i'm not moving around very frequently i

792
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,440
mean at one spot for more than one hours

793
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,039
so easily to

794
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,080
infer

795
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,720
well maybe you are not a student your

796
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,320
student will be moving around to

797
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,960
different classrooms but maybe you are a

798
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,200
staff or a faculty member right so

799
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,000
if you say oh every

800
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,039
every other days you will show up at a

801
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,120
particular building and for about one

802
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,360
hour and a half now i say okay it's more

803
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,120
likely you are

804
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,799
a professor rather than the staff so see

805
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,120
you have not really disclosed any

806
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,360
information explicitly you only have

807
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,919
this person's moving patterns but

808
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,760
already you got lots of information from

809
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,679
this person right and the another

810
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,000
example is on facebook you say i'm not

811
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,919
going to give you any of my personal

812
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,120
information

813
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,039
including my birthday and where i live

814
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:29,840
but

815
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,840
unfortunately if you have your social

816
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,080
networks and you are interacting with

817
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,559
people uh

818
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,519
about 20 some years old and they

819
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,240
are college students and most of them

820
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,000
are from ucla

821
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,720
it's not really hard to infer you should

822
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,760
be in in high probability you are ucla

823
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,840
student right then with other

824
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,000
information probably not stored in that

825
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,360
particular app

826
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,679
then people can identify you

827
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:58,559
so

828
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,559
because i'm in this

829
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:03,039
news business now you know when you do

830
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,000
ads targeting if you just use the user's

831
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,919
news data itself

832
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,720
so i was joking with our engineers i say

833
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,000
well i

834
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,679
i read uh

835
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,880
election news let's say i'm either pro

836
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,760
republican or pro democrats

837
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,120
just based on either i go to cnn or fox

838
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,080
news can you target me with ads

839
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,799
right this is just ridiculous if i

840
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,840
i'm a democrat do you sell me tesla or

841
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,600
do you want to sell me for

842
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,480
it's not very clear so i said well news

843
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,399
data news reading history

844
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,799
using those to target ads it's kind of

845
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,480
ridiculous but then all companies

846
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,960
would buy information data information

847
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,320
from browsers from other sources

848
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,640
and the facebook information i just gave

849
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,360
you

850
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,080
i was doing a search on google i was not

851
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,159
doing a search on facebook i would never

852
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,559
do a search on facebook saying oh my

853
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,799
knee hurts what should i do i did a

854
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,519
search on google but how come facebook

855
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,239
will pop up this particular ad right so

856
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,918
somewhere someone was collecting

857
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:12,480
information then they aggregate

858
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,679
all information from all different apps

859
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,800
maybe through the browser or somewhere

860
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,359
then they aggregate and they target

861
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,760
myself so if you just look at one

862
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,560
application you may say oh i'm very safe

863
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,839
no problem

864
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,239
virtually about everything but when i

865
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,679
collaborate with

866
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,079
some other applications then maybe our

867
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,480
pi will be identified

868
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,879
so there are many horrible switch

869
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,119
scenarios you probably can

870
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,280
find on the internet

871
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,040
if a person really want to target you

872
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,359
find who you are

873
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,918
it's not impossible so

874
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:53,440
so a basic practice is as following uh

875
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,399
like i say if you have a consumer's data

876
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,720
right you want to say i want to separate

877
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,359
the data into two relational relational

878
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,760
database tables and

879
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,680
in one table i can store his or her name

880
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,640
and the personal uh

881
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,440
information or personal identifiable

882
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,040
information and then have a hash id

883
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,320
then using this hash id i can join

884
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,280
another table the key will be hash id

885
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,079
unique hid or you want to say maybe the

886
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,400
hid may not mean to be unique so that's

887
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,520
another way to make sure the data uh you

888
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,440
cannot target one person maybe just a

889
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,000
google person then hash id

890
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,359
has

891
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,119
then indexed to

892
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,839
non-pii information so

893
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,520
the table this second table can be

894
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,160
accessed by a data processor if they

895
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,720
look at the table they look at hash id

896
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,240
they look at all these num pi

897
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,560
information they are fine they are not

898
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,720
able to be able to identify who is doing

899
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,480
what right only data controller oh

900
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,040
he or she can join two tables to know oh

901
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,760
this person with this hash id is edward

902
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,160
so edward has accessed

903
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,680
facebook and google in the last few days

904
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,280
so this is a

905
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,920
very primitive way of

906
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,280
trying to be compliant but for sure

907
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,280
it's not really in fully compliance

908
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,960
so the second

909
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,160
method is differential differential of

910
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,200
privacy this was proposed by

911
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,440
professors in hong kong

912
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,640
ust uh the idea was

913
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,680
i don't really need to separate your api

914
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,599
from your

915
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,800
his access history but i just need to

916
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,520
introduce noise to the data right in

917
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,440
this example here

918
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,119
on the top you see

919
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,800
you have a very specific information

920
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,920
about person including office in london

921
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,599
department i t

922
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:56,880
date joint

923
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,400
2015 and sell information and so on so

924
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,240
forth right if you get a hold of this

925
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,920
this piece of information

926
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,160
uh in the company if you work in a

927
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,880
company you see this it's probably not

928
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,040
not very challenging to infer who is

929
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,240
this person

930
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,160
so you say okay i'm going to

931
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,760
try to

932
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,000
introduce noise so rather than london i

933
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,599
say well uk

934
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,040
and

935
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,000
they joint i wouldn't want to specify

936
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,480
the the month just a year

937
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,240
then the day of birth i specify and then

938
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,160
maybe just a decade or an hour time but

939
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,520
still this is not booty proof so but

940
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,160
in theory uh differential privacy is

941
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,000
attractive because they can come up with

942
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,720
a

943
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,520
quantifiable method to safeguarding

944
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,800
privacy

945
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,040
and you can see the formula is in the

946
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,280
middle of the screen the idea here there

947
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,359
are two uh parameters one is this uh uh

948
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,520
sigma parameter so they have this sigma

949
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,680
algebra the sigma edgewise i'm going to

950
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,560
introduce introduce to your data certain

951
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,800
noise right so

952
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,119
for particular field we already seen you

953
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,160
say well i'm going to apply this uh

954
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,440
age expansion or

955
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,640
birthday kind of anonymize your year but

956
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,359
we put your day and month over there

957
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,839
this kind of algebra and

958
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,079
then they have these privacy parameters

959
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,839
right they say well it's just like a

960
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,680
newest neighbor search and so last time

961
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,359
we covered newspaper but we didn't

962
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,760
finish we continued next time was when

963
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,400
you do a news neighbor search you don't

964
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,720
get just yourself you get a group of

965
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,960
people so then you say i cannot really

966
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,880
pin you down as

967
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,280
a particular person in a group so this

968
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,839
is this appstore means you can introduce

969
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,680
this epson and

970
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,440
then there's a trade-off here for the

971
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,760
company to decide you see the left-hand

972
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,800
side the trade-off is oh private

973
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,280
private privacy magic so you want to

974
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,320
save guardian privacy then the epsilon

975
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,200
value need to be very small but if you

976
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,200
say well i don't quite care about your

977
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,920
policy i care about uh utility sorry

978
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,280
it's the other way if you want to

979
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,599
safeguarding privacy epsilon value need

980
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,359
to be large so

981
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:16,960
when you want to

982
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,280
when the information is given you you

983
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,359
identify actually a lot of people not

984
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,920
just a small number of people so it's

985
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,079
hard to pin down one individual and by

986
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,800
the same nice utility metric so if i get

987
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,280
a whole bunch of people here then

988
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,599
these applications suppose i want to do

989
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:34,640
uh

990
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,119
do a search i want to do information

991
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,000
dissemination recommendation then my

992
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,160
accuracy right the applications target

993
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,880
performance metrics will suffer

994
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,000
and for

995
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,480
any company which needs to

996
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,960
generate revenue the revenue for sure

997
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,480
will go down

998
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,119
so the question here is very very simple

999
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,280
uh

1000
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,000
privacy is possible to be implemented

1001
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,800
right so you say my privacy regulation

1002
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,720
is very loose and comply with privacy

1003
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,319
eventually

1004
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:11,359
can be

1005
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,520
kind of enhanced but i'm going to lose a

1006
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,400
lot of revenue will the company do that

1007
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,880
or would they try to do any kind of

1008
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,640
circumvention to prevent compounds so

1009
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,000
this is a real problem and that's the

1010
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,160
reason again probability becomes

1011
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,319
important so let's come back to look at

1012
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,760
this differential privacy and depends on

1013
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,359
how large the epsilon you want it to be

1014
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,240
the privacy can be a local privacy or a

1015
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,960
global privacy local privacy means okay

1016
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,440
i have a small group of people i just

1017
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,400
want to

1018
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,640
implement this

1019
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,760
sigma algebra so magically

1020
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,720
alter

1021
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,800
their private data then i have an

1022
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,599
aggregator and eventually i can store

1023
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:58,880
the data

1024
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,920
but

1025
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,640
i can make my privacy

1026
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,040
slightly more global means i have an

1027
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,839
aggregator i already aggregate

1028
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:11,040
information from a large number of users

1029
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,240
let's say female or male then i use a

1030
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,680
magic formula to alter them right so

1031
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,960
then i have this anonymous output and

1032
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,839
because the input is a group of people

1033
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,160
so it's much harder to track back to

1034
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,280
individuals so when you combine both

1035
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,040
right suppose i say well your private

1036
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,560
data

1037
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,079
individual data i'm going to do a

1038
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,599
shuffling and then i do another layer i

1039
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,480
analyze the shuffling results and

1040
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,480
applying even more magic

1041
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,040
then i really anonymize every everyone

1042
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,599
so the question is let's say the the

1043
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,640
final master is probably the most secure

1044
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,079
one but

1045
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,640
it probably provides uh

1046
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,839
the the business usage information

1047
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,880
to make their profit right so again this

1048
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,160
is a big trade-off situation

1049
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,000
so people are trying to

1050
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,480
do this differential privacy

1051
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,760
uh then

1052
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,720
i think it's kind of uh dying out now

1053
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,599
it's really hard to prove to an auditor

1054
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:16,400
saying

1055
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,440
this is my epsilon this is my sigma

1056
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,440
so

1057
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,960
this is this is the way i conduct the

1058
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,680
business and i prove in theory this will

1059
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,079
work but no you cannot prove everything

1060
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,319
is done empirically and the even you

1061
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,160
show the empirical data and who can

1062
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,640
trust you in pure data so harvard

1063
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,119
published this uh interesting article

1064
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,680
it's interesting but it was not very

1065
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,560
sung basically this paper saying well

1066
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,599
you you do your differentiate uh

1067
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:46,960
differential

1068
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,760
or pseudo

1069
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,400
anonymization on the data but we can

1070
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,000
re-engineering we identify the users

1071
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,040
right so

1072
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,400
the experience they did was they get

1073
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,240
about 300 users data from the the

1074
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,040
medical databases then they say well

1075
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,599
everyone was anonymized so let's start

1076
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,560
to add additional information let's say

1077
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,839
a zip code and date of birth and so on

1078
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,160
and so forth at the end they say well we

1079
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,200
can identify accurately about 90 of

1080
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,480
people

1081
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,520
so

1082
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,800
i

1083
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,599
really i mean i understand this is a

1084
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,359
kind of uh uh

1085
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,000
interesting result showing the more

1086
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,079
personal data you know about a person

1087
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,160
you can more accurately infer who the

1088
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,800
person is but this is no brander right

1089
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,520
so the the change to me was if you only

1090
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,920
have 300 pieces with information then

1091
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,440
you clam you can identify person 95

1092
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,839
accurately i think it's an easy problem

1093
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:53,119
but if you enlarge your pool from 300 to

1094
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,079
3 million and i bet even with the zip

1095
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,839
code

1096
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,000
you cannot do that and if you have day

1097
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,119
of birth here frankly

1098
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,280
uh even even with 1 million people the

1099
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,480
accuracy can still be quite high right

1100
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,000
so i respect the paper but

1101
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,839
the paper itself didn't really tell me

1102
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,920
any promising or exciting methods

1103
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,280
so federated learning it started from

1104
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,880
2017

1105
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,720
google uh

1106
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,839
wrote a paper and also a blog introduced

1107
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,200
the method the method is very logical so

1108
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,839
we all have our

1109
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,960
devices our

1110
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,599
laptop or cell phone and whatever

1111
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,920
personal devices and

1112
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,119
we don't

1113
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,960
send our private data

1114
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,079
to the app to the concluder cloud

1115
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,880
so all data mining all this kind of

1116
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,440
machine learning will be conducted on

1117
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,880
the phone right so after

1118
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,680
the machine learning has been conducted

1119
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,960
the model has been learned on the phone

1120
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,040
then the model will be sent

1121
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,800
to the cloud

1122
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,520
and the cloud or is the centralized

1123
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,680
system then will aggregate all the

1124
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,760
information and

1125
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,240
develop the global model and the global

1126
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,880
model will come back in return compared

1127
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,319
to this target

1128
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:23,119
individual cell phones

1129
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,280
so on the one hand this is

1130
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,880
kind of attractive

1131
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,440
on the other hand it also introduces

1132
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,960
arrows to the classification

1133
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,280
and not only introduce these arrows but

1134
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,640
there could be other

1135
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,839
problems let's say

1136
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:39,839
what kind of information you aggregate

1137
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:41,440
suppose

1138
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,839
i own the android system and or

1139
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:48,319
ios so the amount of data i collect is

1140
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,319
not just from one application i actually

1141
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,000
call it data from all different

1142
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,680
applications

1143
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,520
so as i as an example i gave you a few

1144
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,319
minutes ago this is even more dangerous

1145
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,480
than getting all information from one

1146
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,560
applications right one particular

1147
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,440
application but you get all information

1148
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,319
get information from all applications

1149
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:11,520
then you do

1150
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,640
uh

1151
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,359
kind of color collaborating among them

1152
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:17,200
and the kind of information you can call

1153
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,599
it is just totally horrible

1154
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,760
and okay let's look at healthcare as one

1155
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,920
example suppose i have a

1156
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,920
deep neural net

1157
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,720
and

1158
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,560
this feature shows there are multiple

1159
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,800
layers attention layers and so on so

1160
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,920
forth

1161
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,720
and the idea of this federative learning

1162
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,680
is i'm going to cut off this

1163
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,359
multi-layer neural networks into

1164
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:42,960
two parts

1165
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,599
right so my animation doesn't work but

1166
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:48,240
actually the key thing is in the middle

1167
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,160
here let's say i draw a line in the

1168
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,359
middle here

1169
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:52,960
okay okay actually this picture will

1170
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:53,760
show

1171
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,040
so i have four hospitals each has been

1172
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,079
training the model based on their let's

1173
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:03,200
say x-ray data they want to do this cd

1174
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,640
scan or

1175
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,480
maybe lung disease

1176
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,839
classification

1177
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:09,839
so each hospital have collected certain

1178
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:12,000
data then run their own

1179
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,960
training algorithms and then i say okay

1180
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,040
i'm going to cut your

1181
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,440
neural net into a half

1182
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,280
so the top half

1183
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,880
so you learn in the middle then i say

1184
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,680
stop don't continue learning just ship

1185
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,920
me all the model parameters

1186
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,160
then you say okay i'm going to continue

1187
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,280
learning here in my center database so

1188
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,880
you guys stop learning i'm going to

1189
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,200
aggregate right so at the bottom here

1190
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,240
you show this is a send central

1191
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,040
centralized continuous learning and

1192
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,960
getting parameters from all different

1193
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,400
sites

1194
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,520
and

1195
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,920
this method seems to be

1196
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,200
reasonable

1197
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,599
but there are clearly

1198
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,760
two shortcomings from medical

1199
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,040
perspective

1200
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,720
the first shortcoming is

1201
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,720
as angeline said

1202
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,880
every hospital

1203
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,160
may collect data using different process

1204
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,960
different devices or even same device

1205
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,079
same device with different process or

1206
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,440
calibrations

1207
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,079
so when you aggregate the parameters in

1208
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:20,800
this subsequent model uh those

1209
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,440
parameters may not agree with each other

1210
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,119
and that could problematic because

1211
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,040
each other will become

1212
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,079
your

1213
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:33,040
noisy disturbance rather than trying to

1214
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,720
help you so for the test data

1215
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,559
that could be this method could be

1216
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,480
productive because text it attached is

1217
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,319
the text but for imagery this pipeline

1218
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:46,960
may not be able to improve your accuracy

1219
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,680
and in practice i see these kind of

1220
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,440
methods

1221
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,800
it's really hard to be realized because

1222
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,800
no hospital here

1223
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,520
would trust other hospitals

1224
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,520
every hospital consider their own data

1225
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,480
to be

1226
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,640
to be a piece of gold they don't want to

1227
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,240
share with others

1228
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,880
so only perhaps

1229
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,000
in on android phone or on ios this

1230
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,200
federated learning can be conducted but

1231
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,920
for health care i have

1232
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,200
really strong doubt okay

1233
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,880
so problem solved

1234
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,240
and i

1235
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,680
don't think so and the two key problems

1236
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,359
one already

1237
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:32,480
enumerate which is the trade-off between

1238
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,319
privacy safeguarding

1239
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,160
and the utility to the company or

1240
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,319
revenue of the company right this is

1241
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,160
always an ethical problem

1242
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,040
and

1243
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,040
a company

1244
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,960
ipo post ipo company they have

1245
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,440
obligation to their shareholders and the

1246
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,520
ceo is under tremendous pressure to

1247
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,559
perform

1248
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:52,880
so i don't know where the

1249
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,520
ceo would draw the boundary then the

1250
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,280
second challenge is

1251
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,760
probability right you can claim anything

1252
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,559
but

1253
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:04,240
ccpa now requires a company to prove

1254
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,640
so this again this is the picture to

1255
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,000
summarize regulations but at the end on

1256
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,400
the right hand side is you should be

1257
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,359
able to

1258
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:16,160
trust the company and

1259
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,240
the company has to be able to prove

1260
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,280
their results and the policies

1261
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,359
so let me spend the remaining time to

1262
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:26,640
introduce saltaria sautare is the

1263
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,680
goddess of greece it's kind of providing

1264
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,559
uh individuals safety

1265
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:33,520
and

1266
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,319
the

1267
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,880
basic idea is we want to lock

1268
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,000
everything

1269
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,040
including user consent user

1270
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,559
revocation

1271
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,680
and so all the consumers actions on

1272
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,480
their data and all these actions

1273
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,720
conducted by the company basically need

1274
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,599
to be

1275
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,520
hardened

1276
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,319
a ledger and this ledger

1277
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,079
if you want to be able to be people to

1278
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:00,319
trust the ledger this ad ledger need to

1279
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:02,880
be open transparent to the public

1280
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,400
so anyone can audit the ledger if i say

1281
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,599
no no this is a centralized system this

1282
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:12,800
is the bank's ledger so you can i i'm

1283
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,599
going to log everything but sorry i

1284
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,839
cannot allow you to come in to see

1285
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:20,079
the details because i don't want you to

1286
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:22,960
see other people's account balance then

1287
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,040
this is a ledger

1288
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,359
which is not transparent and cannot

1289
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,920
bring people's trust okay so

1290
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,559
transparency is the key so that leads to

1291
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,280
the centralized and versus decentralized

1292
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,319
system the centralized system

1293
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,240
by the names basically saying all the

1294
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,119
data all the synchronization is

1295
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:49,200
conducted by one unit right let's say a

1296
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,400
central bank

1297
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,200
or

1298
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,760
all the banks in the u.s uh they have

1299
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,920
this uh bank

1300
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,040
the headquarter bank and all information

1301
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,880
need to be synchronized with the

1302
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,040
headquarters so when a bank want to

1303
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,520
close their books every day they have to

1304
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,040
synchronize

1305
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,119
from the center to all the distributed

1306
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:13,680
bank bank branches to try to reconcile

1307
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,000
their their books and decentralized

1308
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:16,800
means

1309
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,240
all individuals

1310
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,240
can communicate with each other

1311
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,599
and you can

1312
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:25,280
do local decisions but eventually

1313
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,960
we need to be able to reach global

1314
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,559
agreement okay

1315
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:29,839
so

1316
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:32,480
we come back to see an example is this

1317
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,240
centralized banking system uh deposit

1318
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,559
withdrawal and so on so forth let's say

1319
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:41,920
i have two atms i'm using two atms from

1320
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,440
one atm i

1321
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,839
deposit money the other atm i will show

1322
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:48,000
money right so the important thing is

1323
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,640
you need to be consistent you cannot say

1324
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,520
well before my deposit goes in i already

1325
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,720
withdraw my money so i have this kind of

1326
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,960
i kind of double deposit whatever this

1327
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,800
kind of secret scenario and you know in

1328
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,319
the bitcoin situation they want to

1329
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:04,720
safeguarding double spending right you

1330
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,119
say i want to use my bitcoin to buy ten

1331
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:09,760
dollars of uh goods in

1332
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,559
in one company or one store use the same

1333
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:14,640
bitcoin to buy another thing so there's

1334
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,119
a window about

1335
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:19,839
30 minutes for a bitcoin transaction to

1336
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:22,800
be committed within the 30 seconds

1337
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,319
a person can double spend and that

1338
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:27,359
problem has to be closed right so

1339
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:29,200
but bitcoin is a decentralized problem

1340
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,119
it's much more challenging a centralized

1341
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:33,280
problem but central apartment bank is

1342
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,760
one example and another example can be

1343
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,559
hospital so you say okay i'm going to

1344
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:41,119
perform certain process on a patient the

1345
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:42,400
information will be stored in the

1346
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,400
hospital but eventually the information

1347
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,880
had to be sent to who sent to a payer

1348
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,800
right sent to an insurance company so

1349
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,400
insurance company

1350
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,240
pays the bills and

1351
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,119
they

1352
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:54,880
pretty much aggregate all the data

1353
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,839
together they have all heart skills data

1354
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:59,200
and this is

1355
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,599
pretty much universal in canada they

1356
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:04,000
have a universal health care run by the

1357
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,920
government the government has to pay the

1358
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,079
bills so the government has all the

1359
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,240
health care records of the canadian

1360
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,000
citizens

1361
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,680
now again the question is trust if you

1362
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,680
have a centralized system

1363
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,680
how can i trust you because you are not

1364
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,480
going to reveal me all the actions you

1365
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,040
have conducted so

1366
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,079
we like to be able to have a

1367
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:26,480
decentralized system so decentralized

1368
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,720
system the question then will be you

1369
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,559
have certain inconsistency that will

1370
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,160
happen you have

1371
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,240
local agreement but

1372
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,200
globally may not be agreeable so

1373
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,640
therefore

1374
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,680
consensus protocols need to be executed

1375
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,839
so consensus protocol can be separated

1376
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:45,440
into two camps

1377
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,480
one is

1378
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,799
distributed consensus you could have

1379
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:51,280
local consensus eventually you

1380
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,680
convert to global consensus or you just

1381
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,480
have a centralized consensus protocol

1382
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,480
and centralized consensus protocol has

1383
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,119
been out there for many many years

1384
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,440
because bank banks or airline

1385
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,680
reservation systems have been out there

1386
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,480
for more than two decades right

1387
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,880
uh for allies airline reservation

1388
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,880
systems and uh

1389
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,359
when they started about even 20 30 years

1390
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:16,480
ago

1391
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,200
even today they haven't

1392
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,440
be able to really changing the system

1393
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,680
because it's just too many agents try to

1394
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,400
access the database and any modification

1395
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,599
to the system around into the risk of

1396
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:32,400
data corruption

1397
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,200
so we don't get into all these protocols

1398
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,520
in in details because we want to stay in

1399
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,160
a

1400
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,640
on a high level and the server has

1401
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,920
courses to cover uh the detailed message

1402
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,640
and when i was back in the cs department

1403
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,799
20 years ago there was a database course

1404
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:50,799
then there was a transaction processing

1405
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:52,559
course and the transaction partnering

1406
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:53,920
costs will cover

1407
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,040
all these

1408
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,480
protocols to safeguarding agreement

1409
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,799
so let me just give you an example this

1410
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:03,760
is a rudimental consensus protocol talk

1411
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,000
or two-phase commit protocol

1412
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,079
so i have my

1413
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:10,960
participants right and eventually i need

1414
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,920
to make a decision so let's say

1415
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,520
i want to

1416
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,160
have a consensus with in the class to

1417
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,920
say when are we going to do our this

1418
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,119
hypothetically when are we going to do

1419
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:26,960
our final exam and then i send send now

1420
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,440
two dates one is next tuesday another

1421
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,760
one next thursday then

1422
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,400
students start to vote right so

1423
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,240
once i get all the votes i say okay

1424
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,160
majority people vote for

1425
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,720
thursday so i always say i will return

1426
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,119
back to you to say okay now i'm prepared

1427
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:45,680
to come commit because our rule is

1428
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,119
majority wings

1429
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:49,680
and then the decision in the decision

1430
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,760
phase the student will say

1431
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,400
yeah i was i was saying tuesday i prefer

1432
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,520
but now

1433
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,319
the

1434
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,200
kind of

1435
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,119
a majority decision thursday so i'm

1436
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:00,319
going to okay

1437
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:02,480
commit i'm going to decide to commit so

1438
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,280
you have second phase of communication

1439
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,760
so in the two-phase commit protocol here

1440
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,000
you see the overhead

1441
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,720
is the number of messages going back and

1442
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,440
forth to reach consensus

1443
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,400
and if the number of participants is

1444
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,319
small and you have this kind of

1445
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:22,000
centralized system

1446
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,200
and the cost is linear to the number of

1447
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,520
participants right say i have 10

1448
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,240
students and maybe the message will be

1449
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,480
sending back and forth 40 times because

1450
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,839
the two-way messages for each face

1451
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:38,000
but then when you say i want to do

1452
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,599
a global but decentralized kind of

1453
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:42,960
company protocol

1454
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,359
then the cost will be much much higher

1455
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:48,000
will be n square right so everyone has

1456
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,160
to be able to talk to everyone in in the

1457
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,880
most general situation and this is not

1458
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,359
affordable now you say well on the one

1459
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:58,000
hand i want to be transparent i want

1460
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,400
each person to be able to make their

1461
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,599
kind of own decision they can look at

1462
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:05,599
other people's data but on the other

1463
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:08,400
hand i have this kind of enormous cost

1464
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,880
how can i mitigate or i do the

1465
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,520
reasonable trade-off and the trade-off

1466
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,760
easy to understand here is i'm not going

1467
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,359
to talk to it to everyone although i

1468
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:19,760
want to do decentralized system but i'm

1469
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,839
going to talk talk to just a group of

1470
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:24,720
people right a group of people who i can

1471
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,160
trust they say

1472
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,839
i when i want to make a commit decision

1473
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:33,680
or when i say i want to sell my medical

1474
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,599
data record to sahil and

1475
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:39,119
this agreement

1476
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:42,720
only need to be approved or been seen by

1477
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,480
let's say a

1478
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,599
bank of america and maybe tesla only

1479
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:50,400
three because why i don't think they

1480
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,359
together have any interest to con

1481
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:56,000
conspire together to kind of hear me

1482
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,160
right so i say okay that's good enough

1483
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,040
three participants to vote for years now

1484
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,880
i can move on and

1485
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,920
so this is a kind of compromise

1486
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,480
but also reasonable right but if you say

1487
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:12,000
i'm going to randomly select uh a few

1488
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,480
then the situation will be much more

1489
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,599
dicey

1490
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,000
so just sorry talk about the bitcoin

1491
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,920
situation bitcoin is entirely

1492
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,359
decentralized

1493
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:23,040
and they say oh

1494
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,440
if two-thirds of people

1495
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,000
are voting saying your transaction is

1496
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,000
hard it's just just an example or

1497
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,079
when they start to build new blocks

1498
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:37,440
right so when the new boss has been

1499
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,920
granted has been committed they have

1500
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,400
this kind of longest block uh will win

1501
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,720
now this condition so you have a block

1502
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,640
which is six blocks

1503
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,680
longer

1504
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,839
you have a chat which is six longer than

1505
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:52,480
the other chain then all the previous

1506
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,440
blocks will be hardened or

1507
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,680
will be granted or be committed but this

1508
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,480
will take some time right and

1509
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,280
they don't actually identify who are the

1510
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,160
people who can make a block

1511
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,640
committed so it's like racing you have

1512
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,599
to solve a puzzle and when a large

1513
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:13,760
number of people solve a puzzle then the

1514
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,640
block is kind of hardened and

1515
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,960
so who can solve the possible is random

1516
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,200
and they say even you say two-thirds or

1517
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,200
one-half the people in this two-third

1518
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,079
and one-half one-half one-half pool they

1519
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:27,359
are random you don't know whether they

1520
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:29,520
can be trusted or not trusted so

1521
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,599
eventually you know uh

1522
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:33,920
some powerful uh

1523
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,079
kind of resource company they actually

1524
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:39,040
can hack down a bitcoin because they can

1525
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,079
own the majority of gpu in the world and

1526
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:43,520
they can be

1527
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,599
the majority of this kind of voting

1528
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:47,760
scenario right so

1529
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,640
instead of doing that kind of so

1530
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,119
uh expensive computation why not just

1531
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:55,200
saying oh i'm not going to send to 1

1532
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,440
billion people i'm going to get these 10

1533
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,599
people right uh these 10 people have

1534
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:01,520
confirmed interest with each other if

1535
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,079
they saw it or say yes then that's fine

1536
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:06,799
with me so that's pretty much ideal be

1537
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:09,920
between a centralized decentralized and

1538
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,240
decentralized you have this n square

1539
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,960
messaging cost and extra messaging cost

1540
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,359
is huge because you know i o is much

1541
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:19,760
more expensive than cpu or gpu time

1542
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,119
computational time

1543
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:21,920
so

1544
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,319
that would just grind your system to a

1545
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:25,599
halt

1546
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,599
again the trade-off will be okay i'm not

1547
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:29,280
going to talk to n

1548
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:32,480
i'm going to talk uh just a small subset

1549
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,640
of n

1550
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,799
so this decentralized

1551
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:37,680
uh

1552
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:41,040
picture shows the trade-off between cost

1553
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:44,319
and the trust between transparency again

1554
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,559
and the trust and there are so many

1555
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:48,000
different protocols recently got

1556
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,119
proposed

1557
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:51,119
to be able to achieve a very good

1558
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:53,920
compromise between the two so what do i

1559
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,960
say good compromise really depends on

1560
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,760
the applications objective okay i can

1561
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:02,480
again give you a couple examples shortly

1562
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,359
so

1563
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:05,359
consensus versus

1564
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:06,400
transparency

1565
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,039
in the privacy situation uh all the

1566
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:12,240
actions like what can the data allow the

1567
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:16,000
consumer to be uh processed by the by

1568
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,960
the by the business and the the contract

1569
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,039
often about information and

1570
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:23,839
rectification all the information need

1571
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:26,400
to be transparent to the public so can

1572
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,160
be audited

1573
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:31,119
and using blockchain to solve the

1574
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:33,359
problem first of all let's quickly

1575
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:34,400
identify

1576
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,720
the structure of blockchain so a chain

1577
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,799
of blocks let's say

1578
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:42,880
h is the height means i have edge

1579
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,400
individual blocks

1580
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,240
and every block

1581
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,359
may consist of a number of transactions

1582
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:51,440
right in the transaction is in the sense

1583
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:54,079
of bank is straight forward deposit and

1584
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:56,799
uh maybe withdraw or i look at my

1585
01:02:56,799 --> 01:03:00,480
account history in the case of privacy

1586
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,799
every transaction is like oh user

1587
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:05,119
account a user is consent user b's

1588
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:07,760
revocation and uh

1589
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,559
business a access user b's data right

1590
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:12,960
those are the transactions upon your

1591
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,240
data subject will all be locked on the

1592
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:17,680
blockchain

1593
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:21,200
so this is one example or in one single

1594
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,119
block of the chain

1595
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:25,760
and the transactions are organized

1596
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,000
into a merkle tree

1597
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,880
so the characteristic of merkel trees if

1598
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,039
you change one of

1599
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:34,240
the leaf

1600
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:37,039
and then the hash value in the merkle

1601
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:40,240
tree will be modified so why we call

1602
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,480
this indelible because no one can come

1603
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:45,760
here to hack your data if someone did

1604
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,440
then the hashing value will be

1605
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:48,720
mismatched

1606
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,039
and we can identify

1607
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,039
and then this is like a binary tree

1608
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:55,599
eventually going up to the top and we

1609
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:58,720
have this root hash which is usually

1610
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:02,240
easily to authenticate this block is not

1611
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:06,960
contaminated then this block has a

1612
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:11,039
hash index to the previous hash block so

1613
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:14,079
when we in in the index all together you

1614
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,720
can see the blockchain has a number of

1615
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,280
blocks they are linked together with

1616
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,079
this kind of previous uh

1617
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:25,039
previous head address and every block

1618
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:27,680
has a the number of transactions

1619
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:30,559
organized in this merkle tree and it's

1620
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:32,640
very evident why you only have a pointer

1621
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,960
to the previous plot because you have no

1622
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,039
idea when you establish a plot you have

1623
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:39,520
no idea when the next flow will be will

1624
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:42,480
be established

1625
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,440
so

1626
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,839
key requirements here i'm not going to

1627
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:48,559
repeat transparency and the privacy and

1628
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:51,839
probability so now let's let's step back

1629
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:54,400
to see how the blockchain can be

1630
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,280
utilized efficiently because i talk

1631
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:59,119
about bitcoin and you know bitcoin very

1632
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:00,079
well

1633
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:03,039
it's the problem is it's latency right

1634
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:06,000
latency of bitcoin means i

1635
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,559
need to trust a transaction but i need

1636
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:10,960
to wait for about uh

1637
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,160
half an hour because unless the

1638
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,599
transaction

1639
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:18,240
uh the the block which the transaction

1640
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,640
resides get committed

1641
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,640
and in addition

1642
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:25,280
that particular block resides in a

1643
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:28,079
blockchain which has a length six more

1644
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:30,880
blocks than the second longest one then

1645
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,680
i would say okay my transaction has been

1646
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,799
hardened and this will take half an hour

1647
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:39,039
and this is a pretty long time if you

1648
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:41,520
want to do this half an hour transaction

1649
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,079
then payment is impossible you do

1650
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:46,559
payment you go to stock box you say i'm

1651
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:48,480
going to use use blockchain to pay my

1652
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,160
bill the commit time is a six hours so i

1653
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,760
think starbucks wouldn't accept your

1654
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,440
payment so

1655
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,640
like privacy or like uh

1656
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:01,280
currency if you want to use this kind of

1657
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,480
bitcoin methodologies something has to

1658
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:05,359
change

1659
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:08,240
and this is the way we did it so before

1660
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,000
we get into detail let's look at this

1661
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,000
eric poor's cap theorem cap ca p c

1662
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,760
stands for consistency

1663
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:16,480
so

1664
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:19,200
data viewed by different parties need to

1665
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,839
be consistent in the same order right

1666
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:25,440
you say i withdraw then i i deposit

1667
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,960
other people look at the record they

1668
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,200
want to see we saw deposit they want to

1669
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,400
see the other way then you have this

1670
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,880
inconsistent problem availability is

1671
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,440
another one you want the system to be up

1672
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,680
all the time so this is like the cell

1673
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,240
phone networks so if if my if i shut

1674
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,319
down my cell phone now it shouldn't

1675
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:45,039
affect your your cell phone right it's

1676
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:47,680
very easy to understand because you want

1677
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:50,079
your cell phone to be available not

1678
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:52,319
depending on other people's cell phones

1679
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:54,559
and the partition tolerance

1680
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:56,640
and in the banking system partition

1681
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:59,280
tolerance is not allowed but

1682
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,680
in our cell phone scenario general

1683
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:04,160
network scenario internet partition

1684
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,599
tolerance should be

1685
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,280
allowed otherwise

1686
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,680
if my laptop is done your letter needs

1687
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,920
to be in a standby mode that's not

1688
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,680
acceptable so

1689
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:16,240
if we look at this picture then we say

1690
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,400
well in the internet era if we want to

1691
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,240
do a distribute system

1692
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,960
this is one property we cannot sacrifice

1693
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:25,920
right which is partition tolerant okay

1694
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,599
we have to safeguarding this uh

1695
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:32,640
partition torrent property which is p

1696
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,640
but now since every poor theory is

1697
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,559
saying you can only

1698
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:38,880
ensure two out of three properties can

1699
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,400
be guaranteed at a simultaneous at one

1700
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,079
one time so either you choose uh

1701
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:48,559
cp or you choose

1702
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:49,920
a ca

1703
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,599
a pa pa

1704
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:54,880
or only two other three or ca

1705
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,720
the the banks choose ca right they don't

1706
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,559
care about partition tolerance if

1707
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:02,880
there's a partition they shut down the

1708
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,799
system right away they guarantee

1709
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:07,520
consistency and when the system is

1710
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:10,400
consistent they open up they

1711
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:14,400
they make sure it's a scalable available

1712
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,119
so

1713
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:16,799
decentralized system as i just

1714
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:19,279
summarized we need to provide people

1715
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:22,960
just either cp or ap for the sake of

1716
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:25,439
bitcoin they provide this

1717
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:26,238
a

1718
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:28,960
and amp because bitcoin want to be

1719
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:32,080
available all the time and they want to

1720
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,880
also allow a network to be partitioned

1721
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,839
but they sacrifice

1722
01:08:36,839 --> 01:08:39,600
consistency as i again just mentioned we

1723
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,719
think about six hours or half an hour

1724
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:45,040
depending on the situation your

1725
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:48,080
transaction was in an inconsistent state

1726
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,839
so double spending could

1727
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:52,560
happen

1728
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:55,679
and uh summarize bitcoin's problem

1729
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:58,238
one is it's very expensive to maintain

1730
01:08:58,238 --> 01:09:00,799
such a blockchain and one billion

1731
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:04,000
dollars a year and the lack of privacy

1732
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,279
why because you put data on the chair

1733
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:09,198
so now you say edward are you kidding

1734
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:10,880
you want to put medical data on the

1735
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:11,759
chain

1736
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:13,920
so you want to put medical data in the

1737
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:14,960
public

1738
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,640
so i will come back to address the issue

1739
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,640
shortly and

1740
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:23,198
use a pos proof of work protocol means

1741
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:26,238
you want to solve a parcel and nuance

1742
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:29,279
it's very expensive and uh finally low

1743
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:31,520
throughput right transaction per second

1744
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,679
for bitcoin is only seven transactions

1745
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:36,640
per second the ethereum is 15

1746
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,719
not much better

1747
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:40,960
so we if we utilize that to be a payment

1748
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,719
that's impossible and if we want to

1749
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:44,158
utilize for

1750
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:46,719
security privacy preservation

1751
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:49,279
that's kind of also not very convenient

1752
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:52,000
but we can solve the problem so banking

1753
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,600
i talked about the centralized system

1754
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,360
using ca

1755
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,199
and we also already discussed the

1756
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:58,640
trade-off between

1757
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,719
centralized and decentralized

1758
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:02,400
consensus protocols

1759
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:05,280
and then let's look at soteria how can

1760
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,760
you implement a system which is

1761
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,600
at the same time can ensure this uh ap

1762
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:15,920
ap kind of property also can ensure uh

1763
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:19,920
pc my pc and pa at the same time so pc

1764
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,920
and pa if you union a tube

1765
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,920
you become pca

1766
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,560
the trick here is we want to be able to

1767
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:29,120
achieve short latency like one to two

1768
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,040
minutes and the super need to be

1769
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:34,159
extremely high and we are arguing

1770
01:10:34,159 --> 01:10:37,120
this is actually argued by professor uh

1771
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:38,239
measures

1772
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:40,480
professor measures by the way

1773
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,440
he was one of founders of

1774
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:46,800
stellar a standard or the ipo

1775
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,719
is maybe number eight

1776
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:49,679
the

1777
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:51,520
public published company probably ibo

1778
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,840
company on blockchains

1779
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,199
and

1780
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:58,080
he he and us had many many interesting

1781
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:00,719
debates so basically i say okay let's

1782
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:03,040
have this two-layer ball chain so you

1783
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:06,480
have men chen insures ap properties in

1784
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,880
the worst case manchester ethereum it's

1785
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:12,000
in the public domain but the side chain

1786
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,800
will be on the ca using ca property

1787
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:18,159
right we are using uh cp property is

1788
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:20,960
also okay so the side chain will be

1789
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:24,239
very very quick but the mention will be

1790
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:25,679
very slow

1791
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:26,800
so

1792
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,040
this is the picture or sidechain let's

1793
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,440
say even using cs system the mention is

1794
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:34,880
using this is a ap system we organize

1795
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,800
them into three layers

1796
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,199
the first layer is a public chain with

1797
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:41,120
very slow

1798
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,679
response time and high latency

1799
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:46,719
and the second layer with very fast

1800
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:49,120
execution time low latency and high

1801
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:51,760
throughput the method to improve super

1802
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,080
is like david measure said you just

1803
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,080
replicate your cpu right you just

1804
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,640
improve just duplicate your local system

1805
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,520
and i only care about latency you want

1806
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,600
to guarantee latency then when you want

1807
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,280
to guarantee super if you have

1808
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,199
sufficient business you just replicate

1809
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,679
your system so that's a claim by

1810
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:11,760
professor david measures and we have to

1811
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,600
agree with him and finally you have this

1812
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,800
smart contract which is the way to not

1813
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,199
to put data on the blockchain but you

1814
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:21,840
put contract on the blockchain even more

1815
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,120
beautifully

1816
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:25,120
the contrast is in

1817
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:29,360
nature language so if you say i put uh

1818
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,040
something on the blockchain which is my

1819
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:34,000
private data is is really bad if i put a

1820
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,159
digital contract which is a piece of

1821
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:38,880
code on the blockchain in fact

1822
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,800
we will be eventually put a piece of

1823
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:41,679
code

1824
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:43,760
on the blockchain let's say i want to

1825
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:47,040
access your data and this is a agreement

1826
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,679
in nature language but we need to be

1827
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:52,480
able to convert this nature language

1828
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:56,320
statement to a piece of restful api or

1829
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:59,280
sql statement let's say fetch

1830
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,280
something from

1831
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:03,440
relational database k

1832
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:06,640
with attribute equal to what right so

1833
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,520
with this particular piece of code but

1834
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:12,640
already approved then certain people can

1835
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:13,440
just

1836
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,760
execute the code to get your data so

1837
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,560
smart contract is a very important piece

1838
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,120
of information sitting here for two

1839
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:24,080
reasons one through nature language user

1840
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,400
can understand what they are up to then

1841
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,960
we convert the piece of

1842
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:31,040
information into a piece of code and

1843
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:34,000
this conversion i pretty much covered

1844
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,560
when i talked about oval right we had a

1845
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:39,199
lecture about this uh

1846
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:40,320
human

1847
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:43,679
voice speech interface and in that i

1848
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:45,760
talked about in alvo and we need to do

1849
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:48,480
semantic grounding so many grounding in

1850
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:50,960
principle is very challenging but if you

1851
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,679
want to just go on into programs it's

1852
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:57,120
much easier because programs only have a

1853
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,280
small number of instructions and also

1854
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,520
they are not ambiguous right in nature

1855
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,440
language a word can mean multiple

1856
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:06,239
meanings you have polygamy or other

1857
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:08,719
situations but in code when you say

1858
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:11,040
write is right when you say move it's

1859
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,480
move so

1860
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:15,760
smart contract is the good solution

1861
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,320
so smart contract summarizes it it's a

1862
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,040
piece of nature language construct to

1863
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,520
convert to a code and the data is

1864
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,679
offline retrieved by

1865
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:27,520
approved code and the contract

1866
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:29,840
validation relocation execution will

1867
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,600
generate transactions and these

1868
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,159
transactions will be written onto the

1869
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:35,840
blockchain so when you look at a

1870
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:38,400
blockchain you you do see oh i have a

1871
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,640
piece of code executed but the code

1872
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:45,280
number is 722 you have this id and then

1873
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,480
you have

1874
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:49,360
transactions to form a tree and

1875
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:52,880
the root of the merkle tree on the sub

1876
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,960
chain right we say sub chain will be

1877
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,520
very efficient but you say okay i make

1878
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,360
the subject very efficient

1879
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:02,080
but the root of the

1880
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:05,120
merkle tree i lock it to the main chain

1881
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,560
so when i

1882
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:09,199
lock the secondary route to the main

1883
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:11,920
chain the process will suffer from low

1884
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:15,760
tendency but it's okay right because i

1885
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:16,800
can

1886
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,120
locally guarantee

1887
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,280
the transaction has been hardened

1888
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:24,400
but probability can be done

1889
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,880
can be guaranteed maybe half an hour

1890
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,000
later

1891
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:28,880
so

1892
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,040
this is a sabato acceptable to the

1893
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,640
private situation because even i want to

1894
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:35,280
steal a company i cannot file a lawsuit

1895
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,199
within

1896
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:40,320
within half an hour right so i do have

1897
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,480
half an hour probably if you want to

1898
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,080
contact a lawyer to find a lawsuit that

1899
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,880
would probably take a few days so this

1900
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:49,360
hierarchical architecture is just

1901
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,120
beautiful you can accomplish the

1902
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:54,080
objectives to summarize

1903
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,360
we have this

1904
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:57,679
on a side chain we have

1905
01:15:57,679 --> 01:15:59,040
hash blocks

1906
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,600
and they got they got linked together

1907
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,520
and they enjoy the performance of high

1908
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:05,120
throughput because you can replicate the

1909
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:08,880
systems and more importantly low latency

1910
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,880
and the privacy is safeguarded because

1911
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:13,360
we don't store data on the blockchain we

1912
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:17,040
only store uh the id of the code on the

1913
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,280
blockchain data is in the database

1914
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:20,640
access to

1915
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:23,120
the code and then we hash

1916
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:27,120
the root of the local merkle tree to the

1917
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:30,080
global uh blockchain so

1918
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:32,480
when the public auditing

1919
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,880
when the public audit is is conducted

1920
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:37,679
they can go back to the global uh

1921
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:40,719
global blockchain to verify the local

1922
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:44,320
mercury hash value is not altered right

1923
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,600
this

1924
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,719
ensure

1925
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:50,080
often authenticality

1926
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,640
so this picture just to complete when we

1927
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,960
implement system we still need to have a

1928
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:57,360
reasonable user interface if you'd like

1929
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,679
to know the details you can look into

1930
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:02,400
our publication available

1931
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,880
on the internet let me get into slightly

1932
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,719
more details

1933
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:08,480
see on the left-hand side right you have

1934
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,400
interface here

1935
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:13,040
both data consumer data provider

1936
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:16,640
can access through the web and the data

1937
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:19,040
provider let's say i'm a patient i can

1938
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,840
say okay i have a data my x-ray i'm

1939
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:24,560
willing to sell my data at the price and

1940
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,960
data consumer comes in to say this maybe

1941
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:28,960
a pharmaceutical company say i like to

1942
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:32,080
be able to beat uh 20 pieces of data in

1943
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,239
a particular situation or i say i want

1944
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:36,719
to do irb i want to do

1945
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:40,239
some job discovery or or vaccine tests i

1946
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:42,800
need to recoup 10 10 million people or

1947
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,480
10 000 people i can go through the

1948
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,800
system and say who willing to give me

1949
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,800
your vaccine

1950
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,679
drug interaction or side effect data so

1951
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:54,239
then this agreement can be conducted

1952
01:17:54,239 --> 01:17:57,040
through the web application so once the

1953
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,360
consensus have been performed then the

1954
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:02,239
data will be stored right into the

1955
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:04,800
database at the same time the blockchain

1956
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,440
will be also locked on the blockchain

1957
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,840
and then when the audit comes in is the

1958
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,400
bottom is audit audit comes in you can

1959
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,800
look into the local database which

1960
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:17,040
caches the blockchain's information and

1961
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,880
right away i can say well

1962
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,239
the company already fulfilled your

1963
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:22,000
requirement and this is the information

1964
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,920
i can give you right away the response

1965
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:26,239
time for this ats cache tell me just

1966
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:28,640
within seconds then they say no i don't

1967
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,560
trust you i want to go to the core to

1968
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,440
verify then the core will not access the

1969
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,440
company's private data here storing the

1970
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:38,719
cache the core will go to zotero which

1971
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:41,920
is a transparent public ledger and the

1972
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:45,520
court or auditor can go there to access

1973
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,679
the all the transaction transactional

1974
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:49,440
information

1975
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,360
and this is a picture

1976
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:54,400
thanks to professor david measures

1977
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:57,760
monica and the shivaya in ntu and we try

1978
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:00,000
many different local protocols and

1979
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,679
eventually we identify stellar and

1980
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:06,480
tender mean those are two

1981
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,960
good protocols we can employ

1982
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,719
and uh

1983
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:12,880
there's a very strong argument from

1984
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:15,199
professor david measures he's a

1985
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:17,199
no-nonsense guy he said

1986
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:19,600
why do you guys want to use blockchain

1987
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,360
because i can see this entire system can

1988
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:23,679
be implemented by a log only

1989
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:26,239
method it's just log right you just

1990
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:28,960
logging why do you need to

1991
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,080
ensure

1992
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:32,719
consistency in this whole thing this is

1993
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:34,320
not payment

1994
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,080
and we do have a very good counter

1995
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:39,040
argument the counter argument

1996
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,000
ceased

1997
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,719
uh is concerned so if you have time to

1998
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:44,159
think about it

1999
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:44,960
why

2000
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,560
we need to have

2001
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:50,400
consensus on consistency on the order of

2002
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:53,600
transaction in the privacy preservation

2003
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,199
scenario

2004
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:57,360
you know it's an interesting question to

2005
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,120
think about

2006
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,800
uh so we

2007
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,960
did some experiment we conducted but the

2008
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,520
details uh again refer to our

2009
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,920
publications so summarize today's

2010
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,600
lecture lecture

2011
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,679
privacy is very critical if you started

2012
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:14,480
the company you want to be able to

2013
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:17,440
consider privacy before ipos right or

2014
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:18,960
the lawsuit wouldn't come in when you

2015
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:21,199
are a curry company but when you go

2016
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:24,320
public the next day you see a number of

2017
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,920
uh

2018
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:28,159
a number of letters from lawyers

2019
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:30,159
and compass requirement

2020
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:31,840
and

2021
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,600
also some solutions they are

2022
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:36,080
complementary right you can use them in

2023
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,080
a combined method but the ndm

2024
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,000
probability transparency

2025
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,639
they must be safeguarded

2026
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:43,520
and

2027
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:47,120
with this concludes today's lecture uh

2028
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,280
you have questions please ask on the

2029
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:50,800
slack

2030
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,120
and this concludes the lecture today

2031
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:54,239
and

2032
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:57,040
tomorrow i am going to host an office

2033
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:00,400
hour as scheduled and announced and then

2034
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:03,280
next week we look forward to

2035
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,679
seeing your project presentations

2036
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:07,520
and thank you and

2037
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:10,679
go back
