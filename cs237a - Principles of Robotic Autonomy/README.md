near and dear
autonomous systems for people:
- elderly,
- with disabilities,
- motion problems

what do we need for kind of these agents to be able to do they need to complete:
- among people
- environments are changing all the time
- furniture is changing
- sensors uncertainties
- no map / create a simple 2d map

we cannot possibly hardcode everything
1. zero-shot transfer
2. better generalization

 - real data
 - simulations
    - safer
    - cheaper potentially
