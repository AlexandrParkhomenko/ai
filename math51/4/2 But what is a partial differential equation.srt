1
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:09,129
After seeing how we think about ordinary differential
equations in chapter 1, we turn now to an

2
00:00:09,129 --> 00:00:13,349
example of a partial differential equation,
the heat equation.

3
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:17,310
To set things up, imagine you have some object
like a piece of metal, and you know how the

4
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:23,099
heat is distributed across it at one moment;
what the temperature of every individual point

5
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:24,099
is.

6
00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:25,099
You might think of that temperature here as
being graphed over the body.

7
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:29,460
The question is, how will that distribution
change over time, as heat flows from the warmer

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,730
spots to the cooler ones.

9
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:36,390
The image on the left shows the temperature
of an example plate with color, with the graph

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,170
of that temperature being shown on the right,
both changing with time.

11
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:44,329
To take a concrete 1d example, say you have
two rods at different temperatures, where

12
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:47,270
that temperature is uniform on each one.

13
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,879
You know that when you bring them into contact,
the temperature will tend towards being equal

14
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,460
throughout the rod, but how exactly?

15
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,370
What will the temperature distribution be
at each point in time?

16
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:05,430
As is typical with differential equations,
the idea is that it’s easier to describe

17
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,221
how this setup changes from moment to moment
than it is to jump to a description of the

18
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:11,850
full evolution.

19
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,119
We write this rule of change in the language
of derivatives, though as you’ll see we’ll

20
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:19,829
need to expand our vocabulary a bit beyond
ordinary derivatives.

21
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:24,469
Don’t worry, we’ll learn how to read these
equations in a minute.

22
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:28,719
Variations of the heat equation show up in
many other parts of math and physics, like

23
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:33,399
Brownian motion, the Black-Scholes equations
from finance, and all sorts of diffusion,

24
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:38,299
so there are many dividends to be had from
a deep understanding of this one setup.

25
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:42,350
In the last video, we looked at ways of building
understanding while acknowledging the truth

26
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:46,509
that most differential equations to difficult
to actually solve.

27
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:52,380
And indeed, PDEs tend to be even harder than
ODEs, largely because they involve modeling

28
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,280
infinitely many values changing in concert.

29
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,469
But our main character now is an equation
we actually can solve.

30
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:03,609
In fact, if you’ve ever heard of Fourier
series, you may be interested to know that

31
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:08,639
this is the physical problem which baby face
Fourier over here was solving when he stumbled

32
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,099
across the corner of math now so replete with
his name.

33
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:15,950
We’ll dig into much more deeply into Fourier
series in the next chapter, but I would like

34
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:22,480
to give at least a little hint of the beautiful
connection which is to come.

35
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,790
This animation is showing how lots of little
rotating vectors, each rotating at some constant

36
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:31,849
integer frequency, can trace out an arbitrary
shape.

37
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:39,780
To be clear, what’s happening is that these
vectors are being added together, tip to tail,

38
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,560
and you might imagine the last one as having
a pencil at its tip, tracing some path as

39
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,530
it goes.

40
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:51,890
This tracing usually won’t be a perfect
replica of the target shape, in this animation

41
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:55,980
a lower case letter f, but the more circles
you include, the closer it gets.

42
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,940
This animation uses only 100 circles, and
I think you’d agree the deviations from

43
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,090
the real path are negligible.

44
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:10,209
Tweaking the initial size and angle of each
vector gives enough control to approximate

45
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:12,760
any curve you want.

46
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:20,510
At first, this might just seem like an idle
curiosity; a neat art project but little more.

47
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:25,930
In fact, the math underlying this is the same
as the math describing the physics of heat

48
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,319
flow, as you’ll see in due time.

49
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,080
But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.

50
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,439
Step one is to build up to the heat equation,
and for that let’s be clear on what the

51
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,090
function we’re analyzing is, exactly.

52
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,090
The heat equation

53
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,079
To be clear about what this graph represents,
we have a rod in one-dimension, and we’re

54
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:48,439
thinking of it as sitting on an x-axis, so
each point of the rod is labeled with a unique

55
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:51,510
number, x.

56
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:56,790
The temperature is some function of that position
number, T(x), shown here as a graph above

57
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,790
it.

58
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,312
But really, since this value changes over
time, we should think of it this a function

59
00:04:02,312 --> 00:04:05,760
as having one more input, t for time.

60
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,129
You could, if you wanted, think of the input
space as a two-dimensional plane, representing

61
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:15,709
space and time, with the temperature being
graphed as a surface above it, each slice

62
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:23,139
across time showing you what the distribution
looks like at a given moment.

63
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:26,620
Or you could simply think of the graph of
the temperature changing over time.

64
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,960
Both are equivalent.

65
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,750
This surface is not to be confused with what
I was showing earlier, the temperature graph

66
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,240
of a two-dimensional body.

67
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,970
Be mindful of whether time is being represented
with its own axis, or if it’s being represented

68
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,130
with an animation showing literal changes
over time.

69
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:51,410
Last chapter, we looked at some systems where
just a handful of numbers changed over time,

70
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:56,990
like the angle and angular velocity of a pendulum,
describing that change in the language of

71
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,990
derivatives.

72
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,300
But when we have an entire function changing
with time, the mathematical tools become slightly

73
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,800
more intricate.

74
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,920
Because we’re thinking of this temperature
as a function with multiple dimensions to

75
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:12,190
its input space, in this case, one for space
and one for time, there are multiple different

76
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,090
rates of change at play.

77
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:19,240
There’s the derivative with respect to x;
how rapidly the temperature changes as you

78
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,199
move along the rod.

79
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,440
You might think of this as the slope of our
surface when you slice it parallel to the

80
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,830
x-axis; given a tiny step in the x-direction,
and the tiny change to temperature caused

81
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,500
by it, what’s the ratio.

82
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:40,440
Then there’s the rate of change with time,
which you might think of as the slope of this

83
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,740
surface when we slice it in a direction parallel
to the time axis.

84
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,789
Each one of these derivatives only tells part
of the story for how the temperature function

85
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:51,639
changes, so we call them “partial derivatives”.

86
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:55,830
To emphasize this point, the notation changes
a little, replacing the letter d with this

87
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,430
special curly d, sometimes called “del”.

88
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,780
Personally, I think it’s a little silly
to change the notation for this since it’s

89
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,210
essentially the same operation.

90
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:09,160
I’d rather see notation which emphasizes
the del T terms in these numerators refer

91
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,979
to different changes.

92
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:15,910
One refers to a small change to temperature
after a small change in time, the other refers

93
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:22,569
to the change in temperature after a small
step in space.

94
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:26,550
To reiterate a point I made in the calculus
series, I do think it's healthy to initially

95
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:31,590
read derivatives like this as a literal ratio
between a small change to a function's output,

96
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,470
and the small change to the input that caused
it.

97
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:39,370
Just keep in mind that what this notation
is meant to convey is the limit of that ratio

98
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:45,080
for smaller and smaller nudges to the input,
rather than for some specific finitely small

99
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
nudge.

100
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:53,629
This goes for partial derivatives just as
it does for ordinary derivatives.

101
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:56,919
The heat equation is written in terms of these partial derivatives.

102
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:00,550
It tells us that the way this function changes with respect to time

103
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,460
depends on how it changes with respect to space.

104
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:08,280
More specifically, it's proportional to the second partial derivative with respect to x.

105
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,040
At a high level, the intuition is that at
points where the temperature distribution

106
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:18,729
curves, it tends to change in the direction
of that curvature.

107
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:23,250
Since a rule like this is written with partial
derivatives, we call it a partial differential

108
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,250
equation.

109
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:28,550
This has the funny result that to an outsider,
the name sounds like a tamer version of ordinary

110
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:32,949
differential equations when to the contrary
partial differential equations tend to tell

111
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:37,330
a much richer story than ODEs.

112
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,500
The general heat equation applies to bodies
in any number of dimensions, which would mean

113
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,660
more inputs to our temperature function, but
it’ll be easiest for us to stay focused

114
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,220
on the one-dimensional case of a rod.

115
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:52,669
As it is, graphing this in a way which gives
time its own axis already pushes the visuals

116
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:57,000
into three-dimensions.

117
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,580
But where does an equation like this come
from?

118
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,259
How could you have thought this up yourself?

119
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:05,949
Well, for that, let’s simplify things by
describing a discrete version of this setup,

120
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:09,449
where you have only finitely many points x
in a row.

121
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:13,169
This is sort of like working in a pixelated
universe, where instead of having a continuum

122
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:17,060
of temperatures, we have a finite set of separate
values.

123
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,800
The intuition here is simple: For a particular
point, if its two neighbors on either side

124
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,330
are, on average, hotter than it is, it will
heat up.

125
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,380
If they are cooler on average, it will cool
down.

126
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:36,030
Focus on three neighboring points, x1, x2,
and x3, with corresponding temperatures T1,

127
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,789
T2, and T3.

128
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:45,530
What we want to compare is the average of
T1 and T3 with the value of T2.

129
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:50,700
When this difference is greater than 0, T2
will tend to heat up.

130
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,650
And the bigger the difference, the faster
it heats up.

131
00:08:54,650 --> 00:09:03,470
Likewise, if it’s negative, T2 will cool
down, at a rate proportional to the difference.

132
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:09,051
More formally, the derivative of T2, with
respect to time, is proportional to this difference

133
00:09:09,051 --> 00:09:12,290
between the average value of its neighbors
and its own value.

134
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:16,430
Alpha, here, is simply a proportionality constant.

135
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,790
To write this in a way that will ultimately
explain the second derivative in the heat

136
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:24,160
equation, let me rearrange this right-hand
side in terms of the difference between T3

137
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,090
and T2 and the difference between T2 and T1.

138
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,470
You can quickly check that these two are the
same.

139
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:36,370
The top has half of T1, and in the bottom,
there are two minuses in front of the T1,

140
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:40,040
so it’s positive, and that half has been
factored out.

141
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,850
Likewise, both have half of T3.

142
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,710
Then on the bottom, we have a negative T2
effectively written twice, so when you take

143
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:54,000
half, it’s the same as the single -T2 up
top.

144
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
As I said, the reason to rewrite it is that
it takes a step closer to the language of

145
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,070
derivatives.

146
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:04,880
Let’s write these as delta-T1 and delta-T2.

147
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:11,340
It’s the same number, but we’re adding
a new perspective.

148
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,330
Instead of comparing the average of the neighbors
to T2, we’re thinking of the difference

149
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,870
of the differences.

150
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,970
Here, take a moment to gut-check that this
makes sense.

151
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:25,320
If those two differences are the same, then
the average of T1 and T3 is the same as T2,

152
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,590
so T2 will not tend to change.

153
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:35,390
If delta-T2 is bigger than delta-T1, meaning
the difference of the differences is positive,

154
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:41,520
notice how the average of T1 and T3 is bigger
than T2, so T2 tends to increase.

155
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:49,150
Likewise, if the difference of the differences
is negative, meaning delta-T2 is smaller than

156
00:10:49,150 --> 00:11:03,070
delta-T1, it corresponds to the average of
these neighbors being less than T2.

157
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,880
This is known in the lingo as a “second
difference”.

158
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,310
If it feels a little weird to think about,
keep in mind that it’s essentially a compact

159
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:14,130
way of writing this idea of how much T2 differs
from the average of its neighbors, just with

160
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,510
an extra factor of 1/2 is all.

161
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,790
That factor doesn’t really matter, because
either way we’re writing our equation in

162
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,310
terms of some proportionality constant.

163
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:26,110
The upshot is that the rate of change for
the temperature of a point is proportional

164
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,140
to the second difference around it.

165
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:34,860
As we go from this finite context to the infinite
continuous case, the analog of a second difference

166
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,800
is the second derivative.

167
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,610
Instead of looking at the difference between
temperature values at points some fixed distance

168
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:48,560
apart, you consider what happens as you shrink
this size of that step towards 0.

169
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,640
And in calculus, instead of asking about absolute
differences, which would approach 0, you think

170
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,180
in terms of the rate of change, in this case,
what’s the rate of change in temperature

171
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,990
per unit distance.

172
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:04,300
Remember, there are two separate rates of
change at play: How does the temperature as

173
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:09,010
time progresses, and how does the temperature
change as you move along the rod.

174
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,321
The core intuition remains the same as what
we just looked at for the discrete case: To

175
00:12:12,321 --> 00:12:16,310
know how a point differs from its neighbors,
look not just at how the function changes

176
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:24,690
from one point to the next, but at how that
rate of change changes.

177
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:30,380
This is written as del^2 T / del-x^2, the
second partial derivative of our function

178
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,170
with respect to x.

179
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:36,920
Notice how this slope increases at points
where the graph curves upwards, meaning the

180
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,370
rate of change of the rate of change is positive.

181
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:45,860
Similarly, that slope decreases at points
where the graph curves downward, where the

182
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,850
rate of change of the rate of change is negative.

183
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:54,081
Tuck that away as a meaningful intuition for
problems well beyond the heat equation: Second

184
00:12:54,081 --> 00:12:58,910
derivatives give a measure of how a value
compares to the average of its neighbors.

185
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:02,960
Hopefully, that gives some satisfying added
color to this equation.

186
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,430
It’s pretty intuitive when reading it as
saying curved points tend to flatten out,

187
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:11,110
but I think there’s something even more
satisfying seeing a partial differential equation

188
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:16,600
arise, almost mechanistically, from thinking
of each point as tending towards the average

189
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,960
of its neighbors.

190
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,550
Take a moment to compare what this feels like
to the case of ordinary differential equations.

191
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:28,010
For example, if we have multiple bodies in
space, tugging on each other with gravity,

192
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:32,740
we have a handful of changing numbers: The
coordinates for the position and velocity

193
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,110
of each body.

194
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:39,100
The rate of change for any one of these values
depends on the values of the other numbers,

195
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,500
which we write down as a system of equations.

196
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,980
On the left, we have the derivatives of these
values with respect to time, and the right

197
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,830
is some combination of all these values.

198
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:56,840
In our partial differential equation, we have
infinitely many values from a continuum, all

199
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,840
changing.

200
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,790
And again, the way any one of these values
changes depends on the other values.

201
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:07,840
But helpfully, each one only depends on its
immediate neighbors, in some limiting sense

202
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,490
of the word neighbor.

203
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:14,200
So here, the relation on the right-hand side
is not some sum or product of the other numbers,

204
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:20,920
it’s also a kind of derivative, just a derivative
with respect to space instead of time.

205
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:27,110
In a sense, this one partial differential
equation is like a system of infinitely many

206
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:30,080
equations, one for each point on the rod.

207
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:39,760
When your object is spread out in more than
one dimension, the equation looks quite similar,

208
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,490
but you include the second derivative with
respect to the other spatial directions as

209
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,930
well.

210
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:50,500
Adding all the second spatial second derivatives
like this is a common enough operation that

211
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,910
it has its own special name, the “Laplacian”,
often written as an upside triangle squared.

212
00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:00,370
It’s essentially a multivariable version
of the second derivative, and the intuition

213
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:05,190
for this equation is no different from the
1d case: This Laplacian still can be thought

214
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:10,200
of as measuring how different a point is from
the average of its neighbors, but now these

215
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,760
neighbors aren’t just to the left and right,
they’re all around.

216
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:19,521
I did a couple of simple videos during my
time at Khan Academy on this operator, if

217
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:28,380
you want to check them out.

218
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,100
For our purposes, let’s stay focused on
one dimension.

219
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,370
If you feel like you understand all this,
pat yourself on the back.

220
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:40,680
Being able to read a PDE is no joke, and it’s
a powerful addition to your vocabulary for

221
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,170
describing the world around you.

222
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:47,970
But after all this time spent interpreting
the equations, I say it’s high time we start

223
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,210
solving them, don’t you?

224
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:53,300
And trust me, there are few pieces of math
quite as satisfying as what poodle-haired

225
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,630
Fourier over here developed to solve this
problem.

226
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:01,670
All this and more in the next chapter.

227
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:09,720
I was originally inspired to cover this particular
topic when I got an early view of Steve Strogatz’s

228
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,560
new book “Infinite Powers”.

229
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,391
This isn’t a sponsored message or anything
like that, but all cards on the table, I do

230
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,680
have two selfish ulterior motives for mentioning
it.

231
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,520
The first is that Steve has been a really
strong, perhaps even pivotal, advocate for

232
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,600
the channel since its beginnings, and I’ve
had the itch to repay the kindness for quite

233
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
a while.

234
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,090
The second is to make more people love math.

235
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,970
That might not sound selfish, but think about
it: When more people love math, the potential

236
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,050
audience base for these videos gets bigger.

237
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:41,890
And frankly, there are few better ways to
get people loving the subject than to expose

238
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,330
them to Strogatz’s writing.

239
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:48,060
If you have friends who you know would enjoy
the ideas of calculus, but maybe have been

240
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:52,220
intimidated by math in the past, this book
really does an outstanding job communicating

241
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,810
the heart of the subject both substantively
and accessibly.

242
00:16:55,810 --> 00:17:00,410
Its core theme is the idea of constructing
solutions to complex real-world problems from

243
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:05,510
simple idealized building blocks, which as
you’ll see is exactly what Fourier did here.

244
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:08,920
And for those who already know and love the
subject, you will still find no shortage of

245
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,540
fresh insights and enlightening stories.

246
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:15,140
Again, I know that sounds like an ad, but
it’s not.

247
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,780
I actually think you’ll enjoy the book.
