1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,920
Let me pull out an old differential 
equations textbook I learned from in college,  

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:08,880
and let's turn to this funny little exercise 
in here that asks the reader to compute e to  

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,120
the power of At, where A, we're told, is going to 
be a matrix, and the insinuation seems to be that  

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,120
the result will also be a matrix. It then offers 
several examples for what you might plug in for A.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,480
Now, taken out of context, putting a matrix in 
an exponent like this probably seems like total  

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,840
nonsense, but what it refers to is an extremely 
beautiful operation, and the reason it shows up in  

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,960
this book is that it’s useful, it's used to solve 
a very important class of differential equations.  

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,320
In turn, given that the universe is often written 
in the language of differential equations,  

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,400
you see it pop up in physics all the time 
too, especially in quantum mechanics,  

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,120
where matrix exponents are littered throughout the 
place, they play a particularly prominent role.  

11
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,120
This has a lot to do with Shrödinger’s equation, 
which we’ll touch on a bit later. And it  

12
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,440
also may help in understanding your romantic 
relationships, but again, all in due time.

13
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,600
A big part of the reason I want to cover this 
topic is that there’s an extremely nice way to  

14
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,720
visualize what matrix exponents are actually doing 
using flow, that not a lot of people seem to talk  

15
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,360
about. But for the bulk of this chapter, let’s 
start by laying out what exactly the operation  

16
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,440
actually is, and then see if we can get a feel 
for what kinds of problems it helps us to solve.

17
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,560
The first thing you should know is that this is 
not some bizarre way to multiply the constant e  

18
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,920
by itself multiple times; you would be right 
to call that nonsense. The actual definition  

19
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,400
is related to a certain infinite polynomial 
describing for real number powers of e, what  

20
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,240
we call its Taylor series. For example, if I took 
the number 2 and plugged it into this polynomial,  

21
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,600
then as you add more and more terms, each of 
which looks like some power of 2 divided by  

22
00:01:49,600 --> 00:02:00,400
some factorial...the sum approaches a number 
near 7.389, and this number is precisely e*e.  

23
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,040
If you increment this input by 1, then somewhat 
miraculously no matter where you started from  

24
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,960
the effect on the output is always to 
multiply it by another factor of e.

25
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,000
For reasons that you're going to see a bit, 
mathematicians became interested in plugging  

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,040
all kinds of things into this polynomial, things 
like complex numbers, and for our purposes today,  

27
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,600
matrices, even when those objects do 
not immediately make sense as exponents.

28
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,040
What some authors do is give this infinite 
polynomial the name “exp” when you plug in more  

29
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,320
exotic inputs. It's a gentle nod to the connection 
that this has to exponential functions in the  

30
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,160
case of real numbers, even though obviously 
these inputs don't make sense as exponents.  

31
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,680
However, an equally common convention is to 
give a much less gentle nod to the connection  

32
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,240
and just abbreviate the whole thing as e to the 
power of whatever object you’re plugging in,  

33
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,400
whether that’s a complex number, or a 
matrix, or all sorts of more exotic objects.  

34
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,160
So while this equation is a theorem for real 
numbers, it’s a definition for more exotic inputs.  

35
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,360
Cynically, you could call this a blatant 
abuse of notation. More charitably,  

36
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,600
you might view it as an example of the beautiful 
cycle between discovery and invention in math.

37
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,640
In either case, plugging in a matrix, even 
to a polynomial, might seem a little strange,  

38
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,320
so let’s be clear on what we mean here. The matrix 
needs to have the same number of rows and columns.  

39
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,200
That way you can multiply it by itself according 
to the usual rules of matrix multiplication.  

40
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,160
This is what we mean by squaring it. 
Similarly, if you were to take that result,  

41
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,600
and then multiply it by the original matrix 
again, this is what we mean by cubing the matrix.  

42
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,200
If you carry on like this, you can take any 
whole power of a matrix, it's perfectly sensible.  

43
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,440
In this context, powers still mean exactly 
what you’d expect, repeated multiplication.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,120
Each term of this polynomial is scaled by 1 
divided by some factorial, and with matrices,  

45
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,560
all that means is that you multiply each component 
by that number. Likewise, it always makes sense to  

46
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,960
add two matrices, this is something you again to 
term-by-term. The astute among you might ask how  

47
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,200
sensible it is to take this out to infinity, 
which would be a great question, one that I'm  

48
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,520
largely going to postpone the answer to, but I 
can show you one pretty fun example here now.

49
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,440
Take this 2x2 matrix that has -π and 
π sitting off its diagonal entries.  

50
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,680
Let's see what the sum gives. The 
first term is the identity matrix,  

51
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,440
this is actually what we mean by definition 
when we raise a matrix to the 0th power.  

52
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,360
Then we add in the matrix itself, which gives 
us the pi-off-the-diagonal terms. And then add  

53
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,880
half of the matrix squared, and continuing on I’ll 
have the computer keep adding more and more terms,  

54
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,600
each of which requires taking one more matrix 
product to get a new power and adding it to a  

55
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:56,720
running tally. And as it keeps going, it seems to 
be approaching a stable value, which is around -1  

56
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,080
times the identity matrix. In this sense, we 
say the sum equals that negative identity.

57
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,840
By the end of this video, my 
hope is that this particular fact  

58
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,320
comes to make total sense to you, for any of 
you familiar with Euler’s famous identity,  

59
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,800
this is essentially the matrix version 
of that. It turns out that in general,  

60
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,120
no matter what matrix you start with, as 
you add more and more terms you eventually  

61
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,840
approach some stable value. Though sometimes 
it can take quite a while before you get there.

62
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,680
Just seeing the definition like this, in 
isolation, raises all kinds of questions.  

63
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,240
Most notably, why would mathematicians and 
physicists be interested in torturing their  

64
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,360
poor matrices this way, what problems are they 
trying to solve? And if you’re anything like me,  

65
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,840
a new operation is only satisfying when you 
have a clear view of what it’s trying to do,  

66
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,200
some sense of how to predict the output based on 
the input before you actually crunch the numbers.  

67
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,360
How on earth could you have predicted 
that the matrix with pi off the diagonals  

68
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,600
results in the negative identity matrix like this?

69
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,680
Often in math, you should view the definition 
not as a starting point, but as a target.  

70
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,240
Contrary to the structure of textbooks, 
mathematicians do not start by making definitions,  

71
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,720
and then listing a lot of theorems and proving 
them, and then showing some examples. The process  

72
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,080
of discovering math typically goes the other way 
around. They start by chewing on specific problems  

73
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,640
and then generalizing those problems, then coming 
up with constructs that might be helpful in those  

74
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,080
general cases. And only then do you write 
down a new definition, or extend an old one.

75
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,320
As to what sorts of specific examples might 
motivate matrix exponents, two come to mind,  

76
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,280
one involving relationships, and other quantum 
mechanics. Let’s start with relationships.

77
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,920
Suppose we have two lovers, let's call them 
Romeo and Juliet. And let's let x represent  

78
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:54,000
Juliet’s love for Romeo, and y represent 
his love for her, both of which are going  

79
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,360
to be values that change with time. This is an 
example that we actually touched on in chapter 1,  

80
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,880
it's based on a Steven Strogatz article, 
but it’s okay if you didn’t see that.

81
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,400
The way their relationship works is that the 
rate at which Juliet’s love for Romeo changes,  

82
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:15,440
the derivative of this value, is equal to the -1 
times Romeo’s love for her. So in other words,  

83
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,640
when Romeo is expressing cool disinterest, 
that' when Juliet’s feelings actually increase,  

84
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,640
whereas if he becomes too infatuated, 
her interest will start to fade.  

85
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,000
Romeo, on the other hand, is the 
opposite, the rate of change of his  

86
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,320
love is equal to Juliet’s love. So while Juliet 
is mad at him, his affections tend to decrease,  

87
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,520
whereas if she loves him, 
that's when his feelings grow.

88
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,720
Of course, neither one of these numbers 
is holding still; as Romeo’s love  

89
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,240
increases in response to Juliet, her equation 
continues to apply and drives her love down.  

90
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,160
Both of these equations always apply, from 
each infinitesimal point in time to the next,  

91
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,120
so every slight change to one value immediately 
influences the rate of change of the other.

92
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,960
This is a system of differential equations. 
It’s a puzzle, where your challenge is to  

93
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,400
find explicit functions for x(t) and y(t) 
that make both these expressions true.  

94
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,920
Now, as systems of differential equations 
go, this one is on the simpler side,  

95
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,600
enough so that many calculus students 
could probably just guess at an answer.  

96
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,400
But keep in mind, though, it’s not enough to 
find some pair of functions that makes this true;  

97
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,600
if you want to actually predict where Romeo 
and Juliet end up after some starting point,  

98
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:39,840
you have to make sure that your functions match 
the initial set of conditions at time t=0. More to  

99
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:45,360
the point, our actual goal is to systematically 
solve more general versions of this equation,  

100
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,440
without guessing and checking, and it's that 
question that leads us to matrix exponents.

101
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,640
Very often when you have multiple changing 
values like this, it’s helpful to package  

102
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,000
them together as coordinates of a single 
point in a higher-dimensional space.  

103
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,960
So for Romeo and Juliet, think of their 
relationship as a point in a 2d space,  

104
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:10,240
the x-coordinate capturing Juilet’s 
feelings..and the y-coordinate capturing Romeo’s.

105
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,800
Sometimes it’s helpful to picture this 
state as an arrow from the origin,  

106
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,080
other times just as a point; all that really 
matters is that it encodes two numbers. And moving  

107
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,360
forward we'll be writing that as a column vector. 
And of course, this is all a function of time.

108
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,880
You might picture the rate of change of the state, 
the thing that packages together the derivative of  

109
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,720
x and the derivative of y, as a kind of velocity 
vector in this state space. Something that tugs  

110
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,280
on our vector in some direction, and with some 
magnitude indicating how quickly it’s changing.

111
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:52,000
Remember, the rule here is that the rate of 
change of x is -y, and the rate of change of y is  

112
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,280
x. Set up as vectors like this, we could 
rewrite the right-hand side of this equation  

113
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:04,640
as a product of this matrix with the original 
vector [x, y]. The top row encodes Juliet’s rule,  

114
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,560
and the bottom row encodes Romeo’s rule. So what 
we have here is a differential equation telling  

115
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:17,840
us that the rate of change of some vector 
is equal to a certain matrix times itself.

116
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,280
In a moment we’ll talk about how matrix 
exponentiation solves this kind of equation,  

117
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,760
but before that let me show you a simpler way 
that we can solve this particular system, one that  

118
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,560
uses pure geometry, and it helps set the stage 
for visualizing matrix exponents a bit later.

119
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,280
This matrix from our system is 
a 90-degree rotation matrix.

120
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,480
For any of you a bit rusty on how to 
think of matrices as transformations,  

121
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,640
there’s a video all about it on this 
channel, a series really. The basic  

122
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:52,000
idea is that when you multiply a matrix by the 
vector [1, 0], it pulls out the first column.  

123
00:10:53,840 --> 00:11:00,160
And similarly, if you multiply it by [0, 1] 
that pulls out the second column. What this  

124
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,120
means is that when you look at a matrix, you 
can read its columns as telling you what it  

125
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,200
does to these two vectors, known as the basis 
vectors. The way it acts on any other vector  

126
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,480
is a result of scaling and adding these two 
basis results by that vector’s coordinates.

127
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,440
So, looking back at the matrix from our system,  

128
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,680
notice how from its columns we can tell 
it takes the first basis vector to [0, 1],  

129
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,040
and the second to [-1, 0], hence why I’m 
calling it the 90-degree rotation matrix.  

130
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,800
What it means for our equation is that it's saying 
wherever Romeo and Juliet are in this state space,  

131
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,840
their rate of change has to look like a 
90-degree rotation of this position vector.

132
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,640
The only way velocity can be permanently 
perpendicular to position like this  

133
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,560
is when you rotate about the origin 
in circular motion. Never growing nor  

134
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,840
shrinking because the rate of change has 
no component in the direction of position.

135
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,160
More specifically, since the length of this 
velocity vector equals the length of the  

136
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,560
position vector, then for each unit of time, the 
distance that this covers is equal to one radius’s  

137
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:15,360
worth of arc length along that circle. In other 
words, it rotates at one radian per unit time;  

138
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,640
so in particular, it would take 2pi 
units of time to make a full revolution.

139
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,880
If you want to describe this kind of 
rotation with a formula, we can use a more  

140
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,560
general rotation matrix, which looks like this. 
Again, we can read it in terms of the columns.  

141
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,520
Notice how the first column tells us that it 
takes the first basis vector to [cos(t), sin(t)],  

142
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,040
and the second column tells us that 
it takes the second basis vector  

143
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,560
to [-sin(t), cos(t)], both of which are 
consistent with rotating by t radians.

144
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,800
So to solve the system, if you want to predict 
where Romeo and Juilet end up after t units of  

145
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:01,600
time, you can multiply this matrix by their 
initial state. The active viewers among you  

146
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,880
may also enjoy taking a moment to pause and 
confirm that explicit formulas you get for x(t)  

147
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,200
and y(t) really do satisfy the system of 
differential equations that we started with.

148
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,560
The mathematician in you might wonder if it’s 
possible to solve not just this specific system,  

149
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:29,440
but equations like it for any matrix. To 
ask this question is to set yourself up to  

150
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,960
rediscover matrix exponents. The main goal for 
today is for you to understand how this equation  

151
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:40,000
lets you intuitively picture this operation 
which we write as e raised to a matrix, and  

152
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,440
on the flip side how being able to compute matrix 
exponents lets you explicitly solve this equation.

153
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,760
A much less whimsical example 
is Shrödinger’s famous equation,  

154
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,240
which is the fundamental equation describing 
how systems in quantum mechanics change  

155
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,520
over time. It looks pretty intimidating, and I 
mean, it’s quantum mechanics so of course it will,  

156
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:04,400
but it’s actually not that different from the 
Romeo-Juliet setup. This symbol here refers to  

157
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,400
a certain vector. It's a vector that packages 
together all the information you might care  

158
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,960
about in a system, like the various particles’ 
positions and momenta. It's analogous to our  

159
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:18,720
simpler 2d vector that encoded all the information 
about Romeo and Juliet. The equation says that  

160
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,440
the rate at which this state vector changes 
looks like a certain matrix times itself.

161
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,880
There are a number of things making Shrödinger’s 
equation notably more complicated. But in the  

162
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,040
back of your mind you might think of this as a 
target point that you and I can build up to, with  

163
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,920
simpler examples like Romeo and Juliet offering 
more friendly stepping stones along the way.

164
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,760
Actually, the simplest example, which is 
tied to ordinary real-number powers of e,  

165
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,320
is the one-dimensional case. This is when you 
have a single changing value, and its rate of  

166
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,280
change equals some constant times itself. So 
the bigger the value, the faster it grows.  

167
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,280
Most people are more comfortable visualizing 
this with a graph, where the higher the value  

168
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:04,320
of the graph, the steeper its slope, resulting in 
this ever-steepening upward curve. Just keep in  

169
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,000
mind that when we get to higher dimensional 
variants, graphs are a lot less helpful.

170
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,880
This is a highly important equation in its 
own right. It's a very powerful concept  

171
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,640
when the rate of change of a value 
is proportional to the value itself. 

172
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,840
This is the equation governing 
things like compound interest,  

173
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,320
or the early stages of population growth before 
the effects of limited resources kicks in,  

174
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,960
or the early stages of an epidemic while 
most of the population is susceptible.

175
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:38,480
Calculus students all learn about how the 
derivative of e^(rt) is r times itself. In  

176
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,680
other words, this self-reinforcing growth 
is the same thing as exponential growth,  

177
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:51,040
and e^(rt) solves this equation. Actually, a 
better way to think about it is that there are  

178
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,920
many different solutions to this equation, one 
for each initial condition, something like an  

179
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,760
initial investment size or initial population, 
which we'll just call x0. Notice, by the way,  

180
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,560
how the higher the value for x0, the higher 
the initial slope of the resulting solution,  

181
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,760
which should make complete 
sense given the equation.

182
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:18,320
The function e^(rt) is just a solution when the 
initial condition is 1. But! If you multiply by  

183
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,800
any other initial condition, you get a new 
function that still satisfies the property,  

184
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,600
it still has a derivative which is r times 
itself. But this time it starts at x0,  

185
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,680
since e^0 is 1. This is worth highlighting 
before we generalize to more dimensions:  

186
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,600
Do not think of the exponential 
part as a solution in and of itself.  

187
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,240
Think of it as something which acts on an 
initial condition in order to give a solution.

188
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,240
You see, up in the 2-dimensional case, 
when we have a changing vector whose  

189
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,040
rate of change is constrained 
to be some matrix times itself,  

190
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,720
what the solution looks like is also an 
exponential term acting on a given initial  

191
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,319
condition. But the exponential part, in that case, 
will produce a matrix that changes with time,  

192
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,799
and the initial condition is a vector. In 
fact, you should think of the definition of  

193
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,840
matrix exponentiation as being heavily 
motivated by making sure this is true.

194
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:20,560
For example, if we look back at the system that 
popped up with Romeo and Juliet, the claim now is  

195
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:27,359
that solutions look like e raised to this [[0, 
-1], [1, 0]] matrix all times time, multiplied  

196
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:32,400
by some initial condition. But we’ve already seen 
the solution in this case, we know it looks like a  

197
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,200
rotation matrix times the initial condition. So 
let’s take a moment to roll up our sleeves and  

198
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,160
compute the exponential term using the definition 
I mentioned at the start, and see if it lines up.

199
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,400
Remember, writing e to the power of a matrix is 
a shorthand, a shorthand for plugging it into  

200
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,560
this long infinite polynomial, the Taylor 
series of e^x. I know it might seem pretty  

201
00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:00,000
complicated to do this, but trust me, it’s very 
satisfying how this particular one turns out.

202
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,160
If you actually sit down and you compute 
successive powers of this matrix,  

203
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:13,840
what you’d notice is that they fall into 
a cycling pattern every four iterations.

204
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,280
This should make sense, given that we 
know it’s a 90-degree rotation matrix.  

205
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,720
So when you add together all 
infinitely many matrices term-by-term,  

206
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,720
each term in the result looks like a polynomial 
in t with some nice cycling pattern in the  

207
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,880
coefficients, all of them scaled by the relevant 
factorial term. Those of you who are savvy with  

208
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,520
Taylor series might be able to recognize that 
each one of these components is the Taylor  

209
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,800
series for either sine or cosine, though in that 
top right corner's case it’s actually -sin(t).  

210
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,200
So what we get from the computation is exactly 
the rotation matrix we had from before!

211
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,320
To me, this is extremely beautiful. We have two 
completely different ways of reasoning about the  

212
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,360
same system and they give us the same answer. 
I mean it’s reassuring that they do, but it  

213
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,600
is wild just how different the mode of thought 
is when you're chugging through the polynomial  

214
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,640
vs. when you're geometrically reasoning about what 
a velocity perpendicular to a position must imply.  

215
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,560
Hopefully the fact that these line 
up inspires a little confidence  

216
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,080
in the claim that matrix exponents 
really do solve systems like this.

217
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,880
This explains the computation we saw at the 
start, by the way, with the matrix that had  

218
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:45,280
-π and π off the diagonal, producing the negative 
identity. This expression is exponentiating  

219
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,120
a 90-degree rotation matrix times π, which is 
another way to describe what the Romeo-Juliet  

220
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,240
setup does after π units of time. As we 
now know, that has the effect of rotating  

221
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,280
everything by 180-degrees in this state space, 
which is the same as multiplying everything by -1.

222
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,160
Also, for any of you familiar 
with imaginary number exponents,  

223
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:12,320
this example is probably ringing a ton of bells. 
It is 100% analogous. In fact, we could have  

224
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,440
framed the entire example where Romeo and Juliet’s 
feelings were packaged into a complex number,  

225
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,840
and the rate of change of that complex 
number would have been i times itself since  

226
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:27,360
multiplication by i also acts like a 90-degree 
rotation. The same exact line of reasoning,  

227
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:34,320
both analytic and geometric, would have led to 
this whole idea that e^(it) describes rotations.

228
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,920
There are actually two of many different 
examples throughout math and physics  

229
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,400
when you find yourself exponentiating some 
object which acts as a 90-degree rotation,  

230
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,840
times time. It shows up with quaternions or many 
of the matrices that pop up in quantum mechanics.  

231
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,200
In all of these cases, we have this really neat 
general idea that if you take some operation  

232
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,160
that rotates 90-degrees in some plane, often 
it's a plane in some high-dimensional space  

233
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:03,360
we can’t visualize, then what we get by 
exponentiation that operation times time  

234
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,040
is something that generates all 
other rotations in that same plane.

235
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,600
One of the more complicated variations on 
this same theme is Shrödinger’s equation.  

236
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,440
It’s not just that it has the  

237
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,960
derivative-of-a-state-equals-some-matrix-times-that-state 
form. The nature of the relevant matrix  

238
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,320
here is such that this equation also describes 
a kind of rotation, though in many applications  

239
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,240
of Schrödinger's equation it will be a 
rotation inside a kind of function space.

240
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,080
It’s a little more involved, though, because 
typically there's a combination of many different  

241
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,560
rotations. It takes time to really dig into 
this equation, and I’d love to do that in a  

242
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:44,560
later chapter. But right now I cannot help but at 
least allude to the fact that this imaginary unit  

243
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,680
i that sits so impishly in such a fundamental 
equation for all of the universe, is playing  

244
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:55,840
basically the same role as the matrix from our 
Romeo-Juilet example. What this i communicates  

245
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,680
is that the rate of change of a certain state 
is, in a sense, perpendicular to that state,  

246
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:06,560
and hence that the way things have to evolve 
over time will involve a kind of oscillation.

247
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,880
But matrix exponentiation can do 
so much more than just rotation.

248
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,960
You can always visualize these sorts of 
differential equations using a vector field.  

249
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,200
The idea is that this equation tells us that the 
velocity of a state is entirely determined by its  

250
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,480
position. So what we do is go to every point in 
this space, and draw a little vector indicating  

251
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:36,720
what the velocity of a state must be if it passes 
through that point. For our type of equation,  

252
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:54,000
this means that we go to each point v in 
space, and we attach the vector M times v.

253
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,120
To intuitively understand how any given initial 
condition will evolve, you let it flow along this  

254
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,160
field, with a velocity always matching whatever 
vector it’s sitting on at any given point in time.  

255
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:12,000
So if the claim is that solutions to this equation 
look like e^(Mt) times some initial condition,  

256
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,880
it means you can visualize what the matrix 
e^(Mt) does by letting every possible  

257
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:26,480
initial condition flow along this field for 
t units of time. The transition from start  

258
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,920
to finish is described by whatever matrix 
pops out from the computation for e^(Mt).

259
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,400
In our main example with the 90-degree rotation 
matrix, the vector field looks like this,  

260
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:44,160
and as we saw e^(Mt) describes rotation in that 
case, which lines up with flow along this field.  

261
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,080
As another example, the more Shakesperian 
Romeo and Juliet might have equations  

262
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,320
that look a little more like this, where 
Juliet’s rule is symmetric with Romeo’s,  

263
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,320
and both of them are inclined to get carried 
away in response to one and others feelings.

264
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,680
Again, the way the vector field you’re looking 
at has been defined is to go to each point v in  

265
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:10,000
space and attach the vector M times v. This is the 
pictorial way of saying that the rate of change of  

266
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,960
a state must always equal M times itself. But for 
this example, flow along the vector field looks a  

267
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,240
lot different from how it did before. If Romeo 
and Juliet start anywhere in this upper-right  

268
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,040
half of the plane, their feelings will feed off 
of each other and they both tend towards infinity.  

269
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,040
If they're in the other half of the plane, well,  

270
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,800
let’s just say they stay more true to their 
Capulet and Montague family traditions.

271
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,960
So even before you try calculating the exponential 
of this particular matrix, you can already have an  

272
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,840
intuitive sense of what the answer should look 
like. The resulting matrix should describe the  

273
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,440
transition from time 0 to time t, which, if you 
look at the field, seems to indicate that it will  

274
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,840
squish along one diagonal while stretching along 
another, getting more extreme as t gets larger.

275
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,160
Of course, all of this is presuming that e^(Mt) 
times an initial condition actually solves these  

276
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:11,040
systems. This is one of those facts that’s easiest 
to believe when you just work it out yourself.  

277
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,840
But I’ll run through a quick rough sketch.

278
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,120
Write out the full polynomial that defines e^(Mt),  

279
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,000
and multiply by some initial 
condition vector on the right.  

280
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,200
And then take the derivative 
of this with respect to t.  

281
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:41,840
Because M is a constant, this just means 
applying the power rule to each one of the terms.

282
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,960
And that power rule really nicely 
cancels out with the factorial terms.  

283
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,000
So what we're left with is an expression that 
looks almost identical to what we had before,  

284
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,040
except that every term has 
an extra M hanging on to it.  

285
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:05,680
But this can be factored out to the left. 
So the derivative of this expression  

286
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:10,240
is M times the original expression, 
and hence it solves the equation.

287
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,680
This actually sweeps under the rug some details 
required for rigor, mostly centered around the  

288
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,760
question of whether or not this thing actually 
converges, but it does give the main idea.

289
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,040
In the next chapter, I would like to talk more 
about the properties that this operation has,  

290
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,480
most notably its relationship 
with eigenvectors and eigenvalues,  

291
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,200
which leads us to more concrete ways of thinking 
about how you actually carry out the computation,  

292
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,680
which otherwise seems insane. Also, 
time permitting, it might be fun to  

293
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:51,840
talk about what it means to raise e to 
the power of the derivative operator.
