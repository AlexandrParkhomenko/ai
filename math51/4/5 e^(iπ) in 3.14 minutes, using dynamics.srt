00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:05,279
One way to think about the function e^t is
to ask what properties it has. Probably the

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,210
most important one, from some points of view
the defining property, is that it is its own

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:15,220
derivative. Together with the added condition
that inputting zero returns 1, it’s the

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,330
only function with this property. You can
illustrate what that means with a physical

5
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:24,580
model: If e^t describes your position on the
number line as a function of time, then you

6
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:30,610
start at 1. What this equation says is that
your velocity, the derivative of position,

7
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:36,640
is always equal your position. The farther
away from 0 you are, the faster you move.

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,999
So even before knowing how to compute e^t
exactly, going from a specific time to a specific

9
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:45,730
position, this ability to associate each position
with the velocity you must have at that position

10
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:50,100
paints a very strong intuitive picture of
how the function must grow. You know you’ll

11
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,350
be accelerating, at an accelerating rate,
with an all-around feeling of things getting

12
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:59,649
out of hand quickly.

13
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:05,640
If we add a constant to this exponent, like
e^{2t}, the chain rule tells us the derivative

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,760
is now 2 times itself. So at every point on
the number line, rather than attaching a vector

15
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:17,311
corresponding to the number itself, first
double the magnitude, then attach it. Moving

16
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:22,460
so that your position is always e^{2t} is
the same thing as moving in such a way that

17
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,840
your velocity is always twice your position.
The implication of that 2 is that our runaway

18
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,110
growth feels all the more out of control.

19
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:38,880
If that constant was negative, say -0.5, then
your velocity vector is always -0.5 times

20
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,899
your position vector, meaning you flip it
around 180-degrees, and scale its length by

21
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:49,240
a half. Moving in such a way that your velocity
always matches this flipped and squished copy

22
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,640
of the position vector, you’d go the other
direction, slowing down in exponential decay

23
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,869
towards 0.

24
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:04,409
What about if the constant was i? If your
position was always e^{i * t}, how would you

25
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:10,509
move as that time t ticks forward? The derivative
of your position would now always be i times

26
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:15,980
itself. Multiplying by i has the effect of
rotating numbers 90-degrees, and as you might

27
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,650
expect, things only make sense here if we
start thinking beyond the number line and

28
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,730
in the complex plane.

29
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:27,080
So even before you know how to compute e^{it},
you know that for any position this might

30
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,640
give for some value of t, the velocity at
that time will be a 90-degree rotation of

31
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,520
that position. Drawing this for all possible
positions you might come across, we get a

32
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,460
vector field, whereas usual with vector field
we shrink things down to avoid clutter.

33
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:50,090
At time t=0, e^{it} will be 1. There’s only
one trajectory starting from that position

34
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,140
where your velocity is always matching the
vector it’s passing through, a 90-degree

35
00:02:54,140 --> 00:03:01,340
rotation of position. It’s when you go around
the unit circle at a speed of 1 unit per second.

36
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:09,540
So after pi seconds, you’ve traced a distance
of pi around; e^{i * pi} = -1. After tau seconds,

37
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:18,030
you’ve gone full circle; e^{i * tau} = 1.
And more generally, e^{i * t} equals a number

38
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:24,630
t radians around this circle.

39
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:33,360
Nevertheless, something might still feel immoral
about putting an imaginary number up in that

40
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,840
exponent. And you’d be right to question
that! What we write as e^t is a bit of a notational

41
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,161
disaster, giving the number e and the idea
of repeated multiplication much more of an

42
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:47,760
emphasis than they deserve. But my time is
up, so I’ll spare you my rant until the

43
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,400
next video.
