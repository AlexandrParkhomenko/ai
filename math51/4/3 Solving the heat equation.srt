1
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:08,040
We last left off studying the heat equation in the one-dimensional case of a rod

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,830
the question is how the temperature distribution along such a rod will tend to change over time and

3
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:17,429
This gave us a nice first example for a partial differential equation

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,140
It told us that the rate at which the temperature at a given point changes over time

5
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:30,269
Depends on the second derivative of that temperature at that point with respect to space where there's curvature in space there's change in time

6
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,910
Here we're gonna look at how to solve that equation

7
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,320
And actually it's a little misleading to refer to all of this as solving an equation

8
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:42,719
The PDE itself only describes one out of three constraints that our temperature function must satisfy

9
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:48,359
If it's gonna accurately describe heat flow, it must also satisfy certain boundary conditions

10
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,139
Which is something we'll talk about momentarily and a certain initial condition

11
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:56,879
That is you don't get to choose how it looks at time T equals zero that's part of the problem statement

12
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,570
These added constraints are really where all of the challenge actually lies

13
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:07,049
there is a vast ocean of function solving the PDE in the sense that when you take their partial derivatives the thing is going to

14
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,118
Be equal and a sizable subset of that ocean satisfies the right boundary conditions

15
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:18,899
When Joseph Fourier solved this problem in 1822 his key contribution was to gain control of this ocean

16
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:26,280
Turning all of the right knobs and dials. So as to be able to select from it the particular solution fitting a given initial condition

17
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:31,710
We can think of his solution as being broken down into three fundamental observations

18
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,670
Number one certain sine waves offer a really simple solution to this equation

19
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,110
number two

20
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,119
If you know multiple solutions

21
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:44,368
the sum of these functions is also a solution and number three most surprisingly any

22
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:47,219
Function can be expressed as a sum of sine waves

23
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:53,789
Well a pedantic mathematician might point out that there are some pathological exceptions certain weird functions where this isn't true

24
00:01:53,890 --> 00:02:01,079
But basically any distribution that you would come across in practice including discontinuous ones can be written as a sum of sine waves

25
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:08,729
potentially infinitely many and if you've ever heard of Fourier series, you've at least heard of this last idea and if so,

26
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:13,500
Maybe you've wondered why on earth. Would anyone care about breaking down a function as some of sine waves

27
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:21,598
Well in many applications sine waves are nicer to deal with than anything else and differential equations offers us a really nice context

28
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,089
Where you can see how that plays out for our heat equation when you write a function as a sum of these waves

29
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,580
the relatively clean second derivatives makes it easy to solve the heat equation for each one of them and

30
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,699
As you'll see a sum of solutions to this equation

31
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:42,179
Gives us another solution and so in turn that will give us a recipe for solving the heat equation for any complicated

32
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,370
distribution as an initial state here

33
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:51,539
Let's dig into that first step why exactly would sign waves play nicely with the heat equation to avoid messy constants

34
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,470
let's start simple and say that the temperature function at time T equals zero is

35
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,859
Simply sine of X where X describes the point on the rod

36
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,090
Yes, the idea of a-rod's temperature

37
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,080
Just happening to look like sine of X

38
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,709
varying around whatever temperature our conventions arbitrarily label a zero is clearly absurd but in math

39
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:13,488
You should always be happy to play with examples that are idealized potentially

40
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:20,298
Well beyond the point of being realistic because they can offer a good first step in the direction of something more general and hence more

41
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,430
realistic

42
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,579
The right-hand side of this heat equation asks about the second derivative of our function

43
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,510
How much our temperature distribution curves as you move along space?

44
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,019
The derivative of sine of X is cosine of X

45
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,719
Whose derivative in turn is negative sine of X the amount that wave curves is in a sense

46
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,419
Equal and opposite to its height at each point

47
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,130
So at least at the time T equals zero

48
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:54,649
This has the peculiar effect that each point changes its temperature at a rate proportional to the temperature of the point itself with the same

49
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,959
proportionality constant across all points

50
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:03,289
So after some tiny time step everything scales down by the same factor and after that

51
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,289
It's still the same sine curve shape just scale down a bit

52
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:09,770
So the same logic applies and the next time step would scale it down

53
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:16,220
Uniformly again and this applies just as well in the limit as the size of these time steps approaches zero

54
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:22,820
So unlike other temperature distributions sine waves are peculiar in that they'll get scaled down uniformly

55
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,419
Looking like some constant times sine of X for all times T

56
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,329
Now when you see that the rate at which some value changes is

57
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:37,310
proportional to that value itself your mind should burn with the thought of an exponential and

58
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,489
if it's not or if you're a little rusty on the idea of taking

59
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:47,330
Derivatives of Exponential's or what makes the number e special I'd recommend you take a look at this video the upshot

60
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:54,830
is that the derivative of e to some constant times T is equal to that constant times itself if

61
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,210
the rate at which your investment grows for example is always say

62
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:05,629
0.05 times the total value then its value over time is going to look like e to the 0.05

63
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,530
times T times whatever the initial investment was if

64
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:15,829
The rate at which the count of carbon-14 atoms and an old bone changes is always equal to some negative

65
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:23,960
Constant times that count itself then over time that number will look approximately like e to that negative constant times T

66
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,180
times whatever the initial count was

67
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:33,199
So when you look at our heat equation and you know that for a sine wave the right-hand side is going to be negative alpha

68
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
times the temperature function itself

69
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:42,470
Hopefully it wouldn't be too surprising to propose that the solution is to scale down by a factor of e to the negative alpha T

70
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,100
Here go ahead and check the partial derivatives the proposed function of X and T is

71
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,010
sine of X times e to the negative alpha T

72
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,700
Taking the second partial derivative with respect to X that e to the negative alpha T term looks like a constant

73
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,970
It doesn't have any X in it

74
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,809
So it just comes along for the ride as if it was any other

75
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:09,410
Constant like 2 and the first derivative with respect to X is cosine of X times e to the negative alpha T

76
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:16,759
likewise the second partial derivative with respect to X becomes negative sine of X times e to the negative alpha T and

77
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,200
on the flip side

78
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,990
If you look at the partial derivative with respect to T

79
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,400
That sine of X term now looks like a constant since it doesn't have a T in it

80
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:31,640
So we get negative alpha times e to the negative alpha T times sine of X so indeed

81
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,090
This function does make the partial differential equation true

82
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,949
And oh, if it was only that simple this narrative flow could be so nice

83
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:47,389
We would just beeline directly to the delicious Fourier series conclusion sadly nature is not so nice knocking us off onto an annoying

84
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:49,389
But highly necessary detour

85
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:54,139
Here's the thing even if nature were to somehow produce a temperature distribution on this rod

86
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:59,149
Which looks like this perfect sine wave the exponential decay is not actually how it would evolve

87
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,359
Assuming that no heat flows in or out of the rod

88
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,579
Here's what that evolution would actually look like

89
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,460
the points on the left are heated up a little at first and those on the right are cooled down by their neighbors to the

90
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,270
interior in

91
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:18,620
Fact let me give you an even simpler solution to the PDE which fails to describe actual heat flow a straight line

92
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:24,229
That is the temperature function will be some nonzero constant times X and never change over time

93
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,859
The second partial derivative with respect to X is indeed zero

94
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:34,490
I mean there is no curvature and it's partial derivative with respect to time is also zero since it never changes over time

95
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:43,289
And yet if I throw this into the simulator, it does actually change over time slowly approaching a uniform temperature at the mean value

96
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:48,569
What's going on here? Is that the simulation I'm using treats the two boundary points of the rod

97
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,640
Differently from how it treats all the others

98
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,550
Which is a more accurate reflection of what would actually happen in nature

99
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,490
if

100
00:07:54,490 --> 00:08:00,059
you'll recall from the last video the intuition for where that second derivative with respect to X actually came from

101
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:05,790
Was rooted in having each point tend towards the average value of its two neighbors on either side

102
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,910
But at the boundary there is no neighbor to one side

103
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:13,830
If we went back to thinking of the discrete version modeling only finitely many points on this rod

104
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:19,559
you could have each boundary point simply tend towards its one neighbor at a rate proportional to their difference as

105
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:25,410
We do this for higher and higher resolutions notice how pretty much immediately after the clock starts

106
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,410
Our distribution looks flat at either of those two boundary points

107
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:32,859
In fact in the limiting case as these finer and finer

108
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:40,898
Discretized setups approach a continuous curve the slope of our curve at the boundary will be zero for all times after the start

109
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,920
One way this is often described. Is that the slope at any given point is proportional to the rate of heat flow at that point?

110
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:53,989
so if you want to model the restriction that no heat flows into or out of the rod the

111
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,090
Slope at either end will be zero

112
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:02,239
That's somewhat hand wavy and incomplete I know so if you want the fuller details, I've left links and resources in the description

113
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,069
Taking the example of a straight line whose slope at the boundary points is decidedly not

114
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,999
Zero as soon as the clock starts those boundary values will shift in

115
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:17,899
Phantasmal II such that the slope there suddenly becomes zero and remains that way through the remainder of the evolution in other words

116
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,350
Finding a function satisfying the heat equation itself is not enough

117
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:27,409
It must also satisfy the property that it's flat at each of those end points for all x greater than zero

118
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:33,229
phrased more precisely the partial derivative with respect to X of our temperature function at

119
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:40,339
Zero T and at LT must be zero for all times T greater than zero where L is the length of the rod

120
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:48,229
This is an example of a boundary condition and pretty much any time that you have to solve a partial differential equation in practice there

121
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:54,080
Will also be some boundary condition hanging along for the ride which demands just as much attention as the PDE itself

122
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,899
all of this may make it feel like we've gotten nowhere but the function which is a sine wave in space and an

123
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,569
Exponential decay in time actually gets us quite close

124
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,689
We just need to tweak it a little bit so that it's flat at both end points

125
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:12,590
First off notice that we could just as well use a cosine function instead of a sine. I mean, it's the same wave

126
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:18,439
It's just shifted and phased by a quarter of the period which would make it flat at x equals zero as we want

127
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,489
The second derivative of cosine of X is also negative 1 times itself

128
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:30,979
So for all the same reasons as before the product cosine of x times e to the negative alpha T still satisfies the PDE

129
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:37,699
To make sure that it also satisfies the boundary condition on that right side. We're going to adjust the frequency of the wave

130
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,400
however

131
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:45,979
That will affect the second derivative since higher frequency waves curve more sharply and lower frequency one's curve more gently

132
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,760
Changing the frequency means introducing some constant. Say Omega

133
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:55,609
Multiplied by the input of this function a higher value of Omega means the wave oscillates more quickly

134
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:59,719
Since as you increase X the input to the cosine increases more rapidly

135
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,470
Taking the derivative with respect to X

136
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:08,479
we still get negative sign but the chain rule tells us to multiply that Omega on the outside and

137
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,660
Similarly, the second derivative will still be negative cosine

138
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:19,039
but now with Omega squared this means that the right-hand side of our equation has now picked up this Omega squared term, so

139
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:26,539
To balance things out on the left-hand side. The exponential decay part should have an additional Omega squared term up top

140
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:32,419
Unpacking what that actually means should feel intuitive for a temperature function filled with sharper curves

141
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,380
It decays more quickly towards an equilibrium and evidently it

142
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:42,739
Does this quadratically for instance doubling the frequency results in an exponential decay four times as fast?

143
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:48,079
If the length of the rod is L

144
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:55,239
Then the lowest frequency where that rightmost point of the distribution will be flat is when Omega is equal to PI divided by L

145
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,909
See that way as x increases up to the value L

146
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:05,070
The input of our cosine expression goes up to PI, which is half the period of a cosine wave

147
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:11,339
Finding all the other frequencies which satisfy this boundary condition is sort of like finding harmonics

148
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:15,629
You essentially go through all the whole number multiples of this base frequency PI over L

149
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,060
In fact

150
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:24,729
Even multiplying it by zero works since that gives us a constant function which is indeed a valid solution

151
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:30,610
Boundary condition in all and with that we're off the bumpy boundary condition detour and back onto the freeway

152
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:37,719
Moving forward were equipped with an infinite family of functions satisfying both the PDE and the pesky boundary condition

153
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:41,018
Things are definitely looking more intricate now

154
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:46,539
but it all stems from the one basic observation that a function which looks like a sine curve in space and an

155
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:52,629
exponential decay in time fits this equation relating second derivatives in space with first derivatives in time and

156
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:58,419
Of course your formulas should start to look more intricate. You're solving a genuinely hard problem

157
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,729
This actually makes for a pretty good stopping point

158
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,069
So let's call it an end here and in the next video

159
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:07,239
we'll look at how to use this infinite family to construct a more general solution to

160
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:13,420
any of you worried about dwelling too much on a single example in a series that's meant to give a general overview of

161
00:13:13,579 --> 00:13:14,499
differential equations

162
00:13:14,499 --> 00:13:19,599
It's worth emphasizing that many of the considerations which pop up here are frequent themes throughout the field

163
00:13:19,819 --> 00:13:25,329
First off the fact that we modeled the boundary with its own special rule while the main differential equation only

164
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:32,199
Characterized the interior is a very regular theme and a pattern well worth getting used to especially in the context of PDEs

165
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:38,619
Also take note of how what we're doing is breaking down a general situation into simpler idealized cases

166
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:45,369
this strategy comes up all the time and it's actually quite common for these simpler cases to look like some mixture of sine curves and

167
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,039
Exponential's that's not at all unique to the heat equation

168
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,490
And as time goes on we're going to get a deeper feel for why that's true
