1
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:11,860
Last video, I've talked about the dot product.

2
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,809
Showing both the standard introduction to
the topic,

3
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:18,900
as well as a deeper view of how it relates
to linear transformations.

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,720
I'd like to do the same thing for cross products,

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,669
which also have a standard introduction

6
00:00:22,669 --> 00:00:26,580
along with a deeper understanding in the light
of linear transformations.

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,910
But this time I am
dividing it into two separate videos.

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,390
Here i'll try to hit the main points

9
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,210
that students are usually shown about
the cross product.

10
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,210
And in the next video,

11
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:40,140
I'll be showing a view which is less commonly
taught, but really satisfying when you learn

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,140
it.

13
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,430
We'll start in two dimensions.

14
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,080
If you have two vectors v̅ and w̅,

15
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,869
think about the parallelogram that they span
out

16
00:00:47,869 --> 00:00:49,090
What i mean by that is,

17
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,040
that if you take a copy of v̅

18
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,470
and move its tail to the tip of w̅,

19
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,550
and you take a copy of w̅

20
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,869
And move its tail to the tip of v̅,

21
00:00:56,869 --> 00:01:02,050
the four vectors now on the screen enclose
a certain parallelogram.

22
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,220
The cross product of v̅ and w̅,

23
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,820
written with the X-shaped multiplication symbol,

24
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,340
is the area of this parallelogram.

25
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,790
Well, almost. We also need to consider

26
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,370
orientation. Basically, if v̅ is on the

27
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,680
right of w̅, then v̅×w̅ is positive

28
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,930
and equal to the area of the

29
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,470
parallelogram. But if v̅ is on the left of
w̅,

30
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,350
then the cross product is negative,

31
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,130
namely the negative area of that

32
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,780
parallelogram. Notice this means that

33
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,890
order matters. If you swapped v̅ and w̅

34
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,110
instead taking w̅×v̅, the cross

35
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,690
product would become the negative of

36
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,650
whatever it was before. The way I always

37
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,530
remember the ordering here is that when

38
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,240
you take the cross product of the two

39
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,530
basis vectors in order, î×ĵ,

40
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,930
the results should be positive. In fact,

41
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,540
the order of your basis vectors is what

42
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,979
defines orientation so since î is on

43
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:57,190
the right of ĵ, I remember that v̅×w̅

44
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,780
has to be positive whenever v̅ is

45
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,840
on the right of w̅.

46
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,450
So, for example with the vector shown

47
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,610
here, I'll just tell you that the area of

48
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,419
that parallelogram is 7. And since v̅

49
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,719
is on the left of w̅, the cross product

50
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,080
should be negative so v̅×w̅ is -7.

51
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,390
But of course you want to be able to

52
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,080
compute this without someone telling you

53
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,700
the area. This is where the determinant comes
in.

54
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,040
So, if you didn't see Chapter 5 of this

55
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,060
series, where I talk about the

56
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,980
determinant now would be a really good

57
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,790
time to go take a look.

58
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,140
Even if you did see it, but it was a while

59
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,099
ago. I'd recommend taking another look

60
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:37,470
just to make sure those ideas are fresh in
your mind.

61
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,330
For the 2-D cross-product v̅×w̅,

62
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,890
what you do is you write the coordinates

63
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,340
of v̅ as the first column of the matrix

64
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,120
and you take the coordinates of w̅ and

65
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,830
make them the second column then you

66
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:51,569
just compute the determinant.

67
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:53,349
This is because a matrix whose columns

68
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:55,600
represent v̅ and w̅ corresponds with a

69
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,940
linear transformation that moves the

70
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:06,770
basis vectors î and ĵ to v̅ and w̅.

71
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,450
The determinant is all about measuring

72
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:11,500
how areas change due to a transformation.

73
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,090
And the prototypical area that we look

74
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,000
at is the unit square resting on î and ĵ.

75
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,450
After the transformation,

76
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,209
that square gets turned into the

77
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:22,550
parallelogram that we care about.

78
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,070
So the determinant which generally

79
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,890
measures the factor by which areas are

80
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,190
changed, gives the area of this

81
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,340
parallelogram; since it evolved from a

82
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,930
square that started with area 1.

83
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,879
What's more if v̅ is on the left of w̅,
it

84
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,519
means that orientation was flipped

85
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,620
during that transformation, which is what

86
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:44,319
it means for the determinant to be negative.

87
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,050
As an example let's say v̅ has

88
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,959
coordinates negative (-3,1) and w̅ has

89
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,010
coordinates (2,1). The determinant of the

90
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,209
matrix with those coordinates as columns

91
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:59,700
is (-3·1) - (2·1),

92
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,519
which is -5. So evidently the

93
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,819
area of the parallelogram we define is 5

94
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:08,021
and since v̅ is on the left of w̅, it

95
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:09,459
should make sense that this value is

96
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:13,190
negative. As with any new operation you learn

97
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,640
I'd recommend playing around with this

98
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,120
notion of it in your head just to get

99
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,899
kind of an intuitive feel for what the

100
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,839
cross product is all about.

101
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,238
For example you might notice that when

102
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:23,159
two vectors are perpendicular or at

103
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:25,190
least close to being perpendicular their

104
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,370
cross product is larger than it would be

105
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,100
if they were pointing in very similar

106
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,310
directions. Because the area of that

107
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,940
parallelogram is larger when the sides

108
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,380
are closer to being perpendicular.

109
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,660
Something else you might notice is that

110
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,650
if you were to scale up one of those

111
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,550
vectors, perhaps multiplying v̅ by three

112
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,120
then the area of that parallelogram is

113
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,120
also scaled up by a factor of three.

114
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,850
So what this means for the operation is

115
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,500
that 3v̅×w̅ will be exactly three

116
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,310
times the value of v̅×w̅ .

117
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,510
Now, even though all of this is a

118
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,860
perfectly fine mathematical operation

119
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,250
what i just described is technically not

120
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,080
the cross-product. The true cross product

121
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,820
is something that combines two different

122
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,560
3D vectors to get a new 3D vector. Just as
before,

123
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,560
we're still going to consider the

124
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,040
parallelogram defined by the two vectors

125
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,480
that were crossing together. And the area

126
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,229
of this parallelogram is still going to

127
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:23,530
play a big role. To be concrete let's say

128
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,860
that the area is 2.5 for the vectors

129
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,311
shown here but as I said the cross

130
00:05:28,311 --> 00:05:31,210
product is not a number it's a vector.

131
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,389
This new vector's length will be the area

132
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:35,400
of that parallelogram which in this case

133
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,190
is 2.5. And the direction of that new

134
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,850
vector is going to be perpendicular to

135
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,920
the parallelogram. But which way!, right?

136
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,950
I mean there are two possible vectors with

137
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:50,720
length 2.5 that are perpendicular to a given
plane.

138
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,979
This is where the right hand rule comes

139
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:54,940
in. Put the fore finger of your right hand

140
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,980
in the direction of v̅ then stick out

141
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,950
your middle finger in the direction of w̅.

142
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,190
Then when you point up your thumb, that's
the

143
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:08,430
direction of the cross product.

144
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,169
For example let's say that v̅ was a

145
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,060
vector with length 2 pointing straight

146
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,520
up in the Z direction and w̅ is a vector

147
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,690
with length 2 pointing in the pure Y

148
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,070
direction. The parallelogram that they

149
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,660
define in this simple example is

150
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,210
actually a square, since they're

151
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,259
perpendicular and have the same length.

152
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,690
And the area of that square is 4. So

153
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,030
their cross product should be a vector

154
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,670
with length 4. Using the right hand

155
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:36,259
rule, their cross product should point in
the negative X direction.

156
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:37,290
So the cross product of these two

157
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:45,919
vectors is -4·î.

158
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,560
For more general computations,

159
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,930
there is a formula that you could

160
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,680
memorize if you wanted but it's common

161
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,420
and easier to instead remember a certain

162
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,400
process involving the 3D determinant.

163
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,600
Now, this process looks truly strange at

164
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,760
first. You write down a 3D matrix where

165
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,130
the second and third columns contain the

166
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,960
coordinates of v̅ and w̅. But for that

167
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,259
first column you write the basis vectors

168
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:12,740
î, ĵ and k̂. Then you compute

169
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,351
the determinant of this matrix. The

170
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,479
silliness is probably clear here.

171
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:18,820
What on earth does it mean to put in a

172
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,000
vector as the entry of a matrix?

173
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,050
Students are often told that this is

174
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,000
just a notational trick. When you carry

175
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,190
out the computations as if î, ĵ and k̂

176
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,789
were numbers, then you get some

177
00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:36,340
linear combination of those basis vectors.

178
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,340
And the vector

179
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,351
defined by that linear combination, students

180
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:41,690
are told to just believe, is the unique

181
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,020
vector perpendicular to v̅ and w̅ whose

182
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,009
magnitude is the area of the appropriate

183
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:48,270
parallelogram and whose direction obeys

184
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,070
the right hand rule.

185
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,620
And, sure!. In some sense this is just a

186
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,789
notational trick. But there is a reason

187
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:58,150
for doing in.

188
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,530
It's not just a coincidence that the

189
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,931
determinant is once again important. And

190
00:08:01,931 --> 00:08:04,009
putting the basis vectors in those slots

191
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:06,341
is not just a random thing to do. To

192
00:08:06,341 --> 00:08:08,199
understand where all of this comes from

193
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:10,590
it helps to use the idea of duality that

194
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,910
I introduced in the last video.

195
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,190
This concept is a little bit heavy

196
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,069
though, so I'm putting it in a separate

197
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:17,970
follow-on video for any of you who are

198
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,849
curious to learn more.

199
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:22,170
Arguably it falls outside the essence of

200
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,229
linear algebra. The important part here

201
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:25,690
is to know what that cross product

202
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,229
vector geometrically represents. So if

203
00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:29,720
you want to skip that next video, feel

204
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,380
free. But for those of you who are

205
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,039
willing to go a bit deeper and who are

206
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,490
curious about the connection between

207
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,219
this computation and the underlying

208
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:38,200
geometry, the ideas that I will talk about

209
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,019
in the next video or just a really

210
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,190
elegant piece of math.
