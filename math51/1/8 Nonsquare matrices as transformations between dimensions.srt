00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:08,160
Hey, everyone!

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,650
I've got another quick footnote for you between
chapters today.

3
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,340
When I talked about linear transformation
so far,

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,780
I've only really talked about transformations
from 2-D vectors to other 2-D vectors,

5
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,700
represented with 2-by-2 matrices;

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:29,070
or from 3-D vectors to other 3-D vectors,
represented with 3-by-3 matrices.

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,580
But several commenters have asked about non-square
matrices,

8
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,410
so I thought I'd take a moment to just show
with those means geometrically.

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,230
By now in the series, you actually have most
of the background you need

10
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,730
to start pondering a question like this on
your own.

11
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,220
But I'll start talking through it, just to
give a little mental momentum.

12
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,390
It's perfectly reasonable to talk about transformations
between dimensions,

13
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,860
such as one that takes 2-D vectors to 3-D
vectors.

14
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,100
Again, what makes one of these linear

15
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:00,160
is that grid lines remain parallel and evenly
spaced, and that the origin maps to the origin.

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,110
What I have pictured here is the input space
on the left, which is just 2-D space,

17
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,950
and the output of the transformation shown
on the right.

18
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,869
The reason I'm not showing the inputs move
over to the outputs, like I usually do,

19
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:12,899
is not just animation laziness.

20
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:17,549
It's worth emphasizing the 2-D vector inputs
are very different animals from these 3-D

21
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:18,549
vector outputs,

22
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:22,209
living in a completely separate unconnected
space.

23
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:25,820
Encoding one of these transformations with
a matrix is really just the same thing as

24
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,399
what we've done before.

25
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:29,420
You look at where each basis vector lands

26
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,810
and write the coordinates of the landing spots
as the columns of a matrix.

27
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,469
For example, what you're looking at here is
an output of a transformation

28
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:47,310
that takes i-hat to the coordinates (2, -1,
-2) and j-hat to the coordinates (0, 1, 1).

29
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:53,259
Notice, this means the matrix encoding our
transformation has 3 rows and 2 columns,

30
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:57,950
which, to use standard terminology, makes
it a 3-by-2 matrix.

31
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,740
In the language of last video, the column
space of this matrix,

32
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,340
the place where all the vectors land is a
2-D plane slicing through the origin of 3-D

33
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,340
space.

34
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,690
But the matrix is still full rank,

35
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,220
since the number of dimensions in this column
space is the same as the number of dimensions

36
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,330
of the input space.

37
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:20,280
So, if you see a 3-by-2 matrix out in the
wild,

38
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,939
you can know that it has the geometric interpretation
of mapping two dimensions to three dimensions,

39
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:29,670
Since the two columns indicate that the input
space has two basis vectors,

40
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,659
and the three rows indicate that the landing
spots for each of those basis vectors

41
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:37,410
is described with three separate coordinates.

42
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:42,512
Likewise, if you see a 2-by-3 matrix with
two rows and three columns, what do you think

43
00:02:42,512 --> 00:02:43,599
that means?

44
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,500
Well, the three columns indicate that you're
starting in a space that has three basis vectors,

45
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,410
so we're starting in three dimensions;

46
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:55,010
and the two rows indicate that the landing
spot for each of those three basis vectors

47
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,650
is described with only two coordinates,

48
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,610
so they must be landing in two dimensions.

49
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:05,480
So it's a transformation from 3-D space onto
the 2-D plane.

50
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:14,049
A transformation that should feel very uncomfortable
if you imagine going through it.

51
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:18,010
You could also have a transformation from
two dimensions to one dimension.

52
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,519
One-dimensional space is really just the number
line,

53
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,939
so transformation like this takes in 2-D vectors
and spits out numbers.

54
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,769
Thinking about gridlines remaining parallel
and evenly spaced

55
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:32,470
is a little bit messy to all of the squishification
happening here.

56
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,439
So in this case, the visual understanding
for what linearity means is that

57
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:38,780
if you have a line of evenly spaced dots,

58
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:43,870
it would remain evenly spaced once they're
mapped onto the number line.

59
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,450
One of these transformations is encoded with
a 1-by-2 matrix,

60
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,870
each of whose two columns as just a single
entry.

61
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,540
The two columns represent where the basis
vectors land

62
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,940
and each one of those columns requires just
one number, the number that that basis vector

63
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,389
landed on.

64
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:03,170
This is actually a surprisingly meaningful
type of transformation with close ties to

65
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,270
the dot product,

66
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,439
and I'll be talking about that next video.

67
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:09,930
Until then, I encourage you to play around
with this idea on your own,

68
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,390
contemplating the meanings of things like
matrix multiplication and linear systems of

69
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,390
equations

70
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,589
in the context of transformations between
different dimensions.

71
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:18,589
Have fun!
