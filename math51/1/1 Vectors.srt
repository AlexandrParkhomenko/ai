00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:09,660
"The introduction of numbers as coordinates
is an act of violence."

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,360
—Hermann Weyl

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,059
The fundamental, root-of-it-all building block
for linear algebra is the vector, so it's

4
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,059
worth

5
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:19,920
making sure that we're all on the same page
about what exactly a vector is.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,380
You see, broadly

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,820
speaking there are three distinct but related
ideas about vectors, which I'll call the physics

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,990
student perspective, the computer science
student perspective, and the mathematician's

9
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,990
perspective.

10
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,020
The physics student perspective is that vectors
are arrows pointing in space.

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,020
What defines a given

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,320
vector is its length, and the direction it's
pointing in, but as long as those two facts

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,320
are the

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,190
same, you can move it all around and it's
still the same vector.

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,399
Vectors that live in the flat plane

16
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:51,829
are two-dimensional, and those sitting in
broader space that you and I live in are three-dimensional.

17
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:56,309
The computer science perspective is that vectors
are ordered lists of numbers.

18
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:57,309
For example, let's

19
00:00:57,309 --> 00:01:01,020
say that you were doing some analytics about
house prices, and the only features you cared

20
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,020
about

21
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,320
were square footage and price.

22
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,069
You might model each house with a pair of
numbers: the first

23
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:09,380
indicating square footage, and the second
indicating price.

24
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,890
Notice that the order matters here.

25
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,390
In the lingo, you'd be modelling houses as
two-dimensional vectors, where in this context,

26
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,929
"vector" is pretty much just a fancy word
for "list", and what makes it two-dimensional

27
00:01:21,929 --> 00:01:22,929
is the fact

28
00:01:22,929 --> 00:01:25,899
that the length of that list is 2.

29
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:30,139
The mathematician, on the other hand, seeks
to generalise both of these views, basically

30
00:01:30,139 --> 00:01:31,139
saying that

31
00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:35,310
a vector can be anything where there's a sensible
notion of adding two vectors, and multiplying

32
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,310
a

33
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,609
vector by a number, operations that I'll talk
about later on in this video.

34
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:40,609
The details of this view

35
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:44,820
are rather abstract, and I actually think
it's healthy to ignore it until the last video

36
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,820
of this

37
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,560
series, favoring a more concrete setting in
the interim,

38
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,579
but the reason that I bring it up here is
that it hints at the fact that ideas of vector

39
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:53,579
addition

40
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,049
and multiplication by numbers will play an
important role throughout linear algebra.

41
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:01,799
But before I talk about those operations,
let's just settle in on a specific thought

42
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,809
to have in mind

43
00:02:02,809 --> 00:02:04,919
when I say the word "vector".

44
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:07,469
Given the geometric focus that I'm shooting
for here, whenever I

45
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:12,640
introduce a new topic involving vectors, I
want you to first think about an arrow—and

46
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,640
specifically,

47
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,239
think about that arrow inside a coordinate
system, like the x-y plane, with its tail

48
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,239
sitting at the origin.

49
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:23,370
This is a little bit different from the physics
student perspective, where vectors can freely

50
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,370
sit

51
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,469
anywhere they want in space.

52
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:28,950
In linear algebra, it's almost always the
case that your vector will be

53
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,950
rooted at the origin.

54
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,640
Then, once you understand a new concept in
the context of arrows in space,

55
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,420
we'll translate it over to the list-of-numbers
point-of-view, which we can do by considering

56
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,510
the coordinates of the vector.

57
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:45,750
Now while I'm sure that many of you are familiar
with this coordinate system, it's worth walking

58
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,080
through explicitly, since this is where all
of the important back-and-forth happens between

59
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,080
the two

60
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,939
perspectives of linear algebra.

61
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,519
Focusing our attention on two dimensions for
the moment, you have a

62
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,370
horizontal line, called the x-axis, and a
vertical line, called the y-axis.

63
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,370
The place where they

64
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,560
intersect is called the origin, which you
should think of as the center of space and

65
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,599
the root of all vectors.

66
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:10,220
After choosing an arbitrary length to represent
1, you make tick-marks on each axis to

67
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,499
represent this distance.

68
00:03:12,499 --> 00:03:15,510
When I want to convey the idea of 2-D space
as a whole, which you'll see

69
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,531
comes up a lot in these videos, I'll extend
these tick-marks to make grid-lines, but right

70
00:03:19,531 --> 00:03:20,531
now

71
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:22,140
they'll actually get a little bit in the way.

72
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,079
The coordinates of a vector is a pair of numbers
that

73
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:29,610
basically give instructions for how to get
from the tail of that vector—at the origin—to

74
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,999
its tip.

75
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:35,099
The first number tells you how far to walk
along the x-axis—positive numbers indicating

76
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:36,099
rightward

77
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:39,870
motion, negative numbers indicating leftward
motion—and the second number tell you how

78
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,870
far to walk

79
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,739
parallel to the y-axis after that—positive
numbers indicating upward motion, and negative

80
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:46,739
numbers

81
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:48,439
indicating downward motion.

82
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:51,180
To distinguish vectors from points, the convention
is to write this pair

83
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,569
of numbers vertically with square brackets
around them.

84
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:01,519
Every pair of numbers gives you one and only
one vector, and every vector is associated

85
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,519
with one and

86
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,719
only one pair of numbers.

87
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:05,980
What about in three dimensions?

88
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,359
Well, you add a third axis, called the z-axis,

89
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:14,799
which is perpendicular to both the x- and
y-axes, and in this case each vector is associated

90
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,870
with an ordered triplet of numbers: the first
tells you how far to move along the x-axis,

91
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,870
the second

92
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,660
tells you how far to move parallel to the
y-axis, and the third one tells you how far

93
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,660
to then move

94
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,610
parallel to this new z-axis.

95
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,310
Every triplet of numbers gives you one unique
vector in space, and

96
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:37,490
every vector in space gives you exactly one
triplet of numbers.

97
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,710
So back to vector addition, and multiplication
by numbers.

98
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,460
After all, every topic in linear algebra

99
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,330
is going to center around these two operations.

100
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,630
Luckily, each one is pretty straightforward
to define.

101
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,139
Let's say we have two vectors, one pointing
up, and a little to the right, and the other

102
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:53,139
one

103
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:54,280
pointing right, and down a bit.

104
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,410
To add these two vectors, move the second
one so that its tail sits

105
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:04,270
at the tip of the first one; then if you draw
a new vector from the tail of the first one

106
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,270
to where

107
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:12,230
the tip of the second one now sits, that new
vector is their sum.

108
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:16,560
This definition of addition, by the way, is
pretty much the only time in linear algebra

109
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
where we let

110
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,750
vectors stray away from the origin.

111
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,710
Now why is this a reasonable thing to do?—Why
this definition of addition and not some other

112
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,650
one?

113
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:30,000
Well the way I like to think about it is that
each vector represents a certain movement—a

114
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
step with

115
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,330
a certain distance and direction in space.

116
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,470
If you take a step along the first vector,

117
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,590
then take a step in the direction and distance
described by the second vector, the overall

118
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,590
effect is

119
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,610
just the same as if you moved along the sum
of those two vectors to start with.

120
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,880
You could think about this as an extension
of how we think about adding numbers on a

121
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,340
number line.

122
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,720
One way that we teach kids to think about
this, say with 2+5, is to think of moving

123
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
2 steps to the

124
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,539
right, followed by another 5 steps to the
right.

125
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:00,560
The overall effect is the same as if you just
took

126
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,210
7 steps to the right.

127
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,270
In fact, let's see how vector addition looks
numerically.

128
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,270
The first vector

129
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:14,729
here has coordinates (1,2), and the second
one has coordinates (3,-1).

130
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:15,830
When you take the vector sum

131
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,300
using this tip-to-tail method, you can think
of a four-step path from the origin to the

132
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,300
tip of the

133
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,560
second vector: "walk 1 to the right, then
2 up, then 3 to the right, then 1 down."

134
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
Re-organising

135
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,240
these steps so that you first do all of the
rightward motion, then do all of the vertical

136
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,240
motion,

137
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:40,660
you can read it as saying, "first move 1+3
to the right, then move 2+(-1) up," so the

138
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,660
new vector has

139
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,800
coordinates 1+3 and 2+(-1).

140
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,370
In general, vector addition in this list-of-numbers
conception looks

141
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:55,069
like matching up their terms, and adding each
one together.

142
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:58,879
The other fundamental vector operation is
multiplication by a number.

143
00:06:58,879 --> 00:06:59,879
Now this is best understood

144
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:02,050
just by looking at a few examples.

145
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:05,430
If you take the number 2, and multiply it
by a given vector, it

146
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:10,550
means you stretch out that vector so that
it's 2 times as long as when you started.

147
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,550
If you multiply

148
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:17,720
that vector by, say, 1/3, it means you squish
it down so that it's 1/3 of the original length.

149
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:23,130
When you multiply it by a negative number,
like -1.8, then the vector first gets flipped

150
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,130
around,

151
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:27,479
then stretched out by that factor of 1.8.

152
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:31,699
This process of stretching or squishing or
sometimes reversing the direction of a vector

153
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:33,569
is called "scaling",

154
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:39,479
and whenever you catch a number like 2 or
1/3 or -1.8 acting like this—scaling some

155
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:41,069
vector—you call it a "scalar".

156
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:44,940
In fact, throughout linear algebra, one of
the main things that

157
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:50,189
numbers do is scale vectors, so it's common
to use the word "scalar" pretty much interchangeably

158
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:52,039
with the word "number".

159
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:56,849
Numerically, stretching out a vector by a
factor of, say, 2, corresponds to

160
00:07:56,849 --> 00:08:01,479
multiplying each of its components by that
factor, 2, so in the conception of vectors

161
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:02,479
as

162
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,419
lists of numbers, multiplying a given vector
by a scalar means multiplying each one of

163
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:10,629
those components by that scalar.

164
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:14,030
You'll see in the following videos what I
mean when I say that linear algebra topics

165
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,030
tend to revolve

166
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:20,139
around these two fundamental operations: vector
addition, and scalar multiplication; and I'll

167
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:21,139
talk

168
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:25,639
more in the last video about how and why the
mathematician thinks only about these operations,

169
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:29,550
independent and abstracted away from however
you choose to represent vectors.

170
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,939
In truth, it doesn't

171
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:34,570
matter whether you think about vectors as
fundamentally being arrows in space—like

172
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,570
I'm suggesting

173
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:39,289
you do—that happen to have a nice numerical
representation, or fundamentally as lists

174
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:40,289
of numbers

175
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:42,639
that happen to have a nice geometric interpretation.

176
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,970
The usefulness of linear algebra has less
to do with

177
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:49,590
either one of these views than it does with
the ability to translate back and forth between

178
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,590
them.

179
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:55,640
It gives the data analyst a nice way to conceptualise
many lists of numbers in a visual way,

180
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,910
which can seriously clarify patterns in data,
and give a global view of what certain operations

181
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:00,940
do,

182
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,920
and on the flip side, it gives people like
physicists and computer graphics programmers

183
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,920
a language

184
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,470
to describe space and the manipulation of
space using numbers that can be crunched and

185
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,340
run through a computer.

186
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,290
When I do math-y animations, for example,
I start by thinking about what's actually

187
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,290
going on in

188
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:21,590
space, and then get the computer to represent
things numerically, thereby figuring out where

189
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,590
to

190
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,920
place the pixels on the screen, and doing
that usually relies on a lot of linear algebra

191
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,170
understanding.

192
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:31,470
So there are your vector basics, and in the
next video I'll start getting into some pretty

193
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,470
neat

194
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:36,860
concepts surrounding vectors, like span, bases,
and linear dependence.

195
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:42,990
See you then!
