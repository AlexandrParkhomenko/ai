1
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,080
I've introduced a few derivative formulas

2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,120
but a really important one that Ieft out was exponentials.

3
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,740
So here, I want to talk about the derivatives of functions like

4
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,940
Two to the x, seven to the x, and also to show why

5
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,020
e to the x is arguably the most important of the exponentials.

6
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,120
First of all, to get an intuition, let's just focus on the function two to the x.

7
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,140
And let's think of that input as a time, "t," maybe in days,

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,820
and the output, 2 to the t, as a population size

9
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,380
perhaps of a particularly fertile band of pi creatures which doubles every single day.

10
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,660
And actually, instead of population size,

11
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,300
which grows in discrete little jumps with each new baby pi creature,

12
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,640
maybe let's think of 2 to the t as the total mass of the population.

13
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,280
I think that better reflects the continuity of this function, don't you?

14
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,780
So, for example, at time t=0, the total mass is 2 to the 0 equals 1,

15
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,000
for the mass of one creature.

16
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:20,360
At t=1 day, the population has grown to 2 to the 1 = 2 creature masses.

17
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:27,200
At day t=2, it's t squared, or 4, and in general, it just keeps doubling every day.

18
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:34,560
For the derivative, we want dm/dt, the rate at which this population mass is growing,

19
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:39,300
thought of as a tiny change in the mass divided by a tiny change in time.

20
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,260
And let's start by thinking of the rate of change over a full day,

21
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,600
say, between day 3 and day 4.

22
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,200
Well, in this case it grows from 8 to 16, so that's 8 new creature masses

23
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,680
added over the course of one day.

24
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:00,500
And notice, that rate of growth equals the population size at the start of the day.

25
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,660
Between day 4 and day 5, it grows from 16 to 32.

26
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,500
So that's a rate of 16 new creature masses per day.

27
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,420
Which, again, equals the population size at the start of the day.

28
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:17,400
And in general, this rate of growth over a full day

29
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,280
equals the population size at the start of that day.

30
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,720
So it might be tempting to say that this means

31
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,260
the derivative of 2 to the t equals itself.

32
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,720
That the rate of change of this function at a given time t,

33
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,920
is equal to, well, the value of that function.

34
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,480
And this is definitely in the right direction,

35
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,520
but it's not quite correct.

36
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,340
What we're doing here is making comparisons over a full day,

37
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,460
considering the difference between 2 to the t plus 1,

38
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,420
and 2 to the t.

39
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,440
but for the derivative, we need to ask what happens for smaller and smaller changes.

40
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,300
What's the growth over the course of a tenth of a day? A hundredth of a day? One one-billionth of a day?

41
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,920
This is why I had us think of the function as representing population mass

42
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,820
since it makes sense to ask about a tiny change in mass over a tiny fraction of a day

43
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:15,560
but it doesn't make as much sense to ask about the tiny change in a discrete population size per second.

44
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,660
More abstractly, for a tiny change in time, dt, we want to understand

45
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,960
the difference between 2 to the t plus dt

46
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,280
and 2 to the t,

47
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,400
all divided by dt.

48
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:34,340
A change in the function per unit time, but now we're looking very narrowly around a given point in time,

49
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,040
rather than over the course of a full day.

50
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,860
And here's the thing:

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,180
I would love if there was some very clear geometric picture

52
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,640
that made everything that's about to follow just pop out,

53
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,480
some diagram where you could point to one value,

54
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,160
and say, "See! *that* part. That is the derivative of 2 to the t."

55
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,680
And if you know of one, please let me know.

56
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,360
And while the goal here as with the rest of the series

57
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,160
is to maintain a playful spirit of discover,

58
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,120
the type of play that follows will have more to do with finding numerical patterns,

59
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,080
rather than visual ones.

60
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,500
So start by just taking a very close look at this term

61
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,840
2 to the t, plus dt

62
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:21,540
A core property of exponentials is that you can break this up as 2 to the t times 2 to the dt.

63
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,460
That really is the most important property of exponents.

64
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,400
If you add two values in that exponent, you can break up the output as a product of some kind.

65
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,100
This is what lets you relate additive ideas

66
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,760
things like tiny steps in time,

67
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,960
to multiplicative ideas, things like rates and ratios.

68
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,700
I mean,  just look at what happens here.

69
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,260
After that move, we can factor out the term 2 to the t.

70
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,800
which is now just multiplied by 2 to the dt minus 1, all divided by dt.

71
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,920
And remember, the derivative of 2 to the t

72
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:58,240
is whatever this whole expression approaches as dt approaches 0.

73
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,340
And at first glance that might seem like an unimportant manipulation,

74
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,040
but a tremendously important fact is that this term on the right,

75
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,560
where all of the dt stuff lives, is completely separate from

76
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,400
the t term itself. It doesn't depend on the actual time where we started.

77
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,080
You can go off to a calculator and plug in very small values for dt here,

78
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,280
for example, maybe typing in 2 to the 0.001

79
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,360
minus 1, divided by 0.001

80
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,900
What you'll find is that for smaller and smaller choices of dt,

81
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,180
this value approaches a very specific number,

82
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,440
around 0.6931.

83
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,720
Don't worry if that number seems mysterious,

84
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,560
The central point is that this is some kind of constant.

85
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,080
Unlike derivatives of other functions,

86
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,520
all of the stuff that depends on dt is separate from the value of t itself.

87
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,300
So the derivative of 2 to the t is just itself,

88
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,880
but multiplied by some constant

89
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,780
And that should kind of make sense,

90
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,580
because earlier, it felt like the derivative for 2 to the t should be itself,

91
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,900
at least when we were looking at changes over the course of a full day.

92
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,420
And evidently, the rate of change for this function over much smaller time scales

93
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,440
is not quite equal to itself,

94
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,620
but it's proportional to itself,

95
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:23,020
with this very peculiar proportionality constant of 0.6931

96
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,520
And there's not too much special about the number 2 here,

97
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,820
if instead we had dealt with the function 3 to the t,

98
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,740
the exponential property would also have led us to the conclusion that

99
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,980
the derivative of 3 to the t is proportional to itself.

100
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,740
But this time it would have had a proportionality constant 1.0986.

101
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,140
And for other bases to your exponent you can have fun trying to see what the various

102
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,740
proportionality constants are,  maying seeing if you can find a pattern in them.

103
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,380
For example, if you plug in 8 to the power of a very tiny number

104
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,160
minus 1, and divide by that same tiny number,

105
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:12,120
what you'd find is that the relevant proportionality constant is around 2.079,

106
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,120
and maybe, just maybe you would notice that this number happens

107
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,800
to be exactly three times the constant associated with the base for 2,

108
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,060
so these numbers certainly aren't random, there is some kind of pattern,

109
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,000
but what is it?

110
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,900
What does 2 have to do with the number 0.6931?

111
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,080
And what does 8 have to do with the number 2.079?

112
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:42,200
Well, a second question that is ultimately going to explain these mystery constants

113
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,300
is whether there's some base where that proportionality constant is one (1),

114
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,120
where the derivative of "a"to the power t is not just proportional to itself,

115
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,160
but actually equal to itself.

116
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,940
And there is!

117
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,980
It's the special constant "e,"

118
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,580
around 2.71828.

119
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,660
In fact, it's not just that the number e happens to show up here,

120
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,420
this is, in a sense, what defines the number e.

121
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,700
If you ask, "why does e, of all numbers, have this property?"

122
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:18,480
It's a little like asking "why does pi, of all numbers happen to be the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter?"

123
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,380
This is, at its heart, what defines this value.

124
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,200
All exponential functions are proportional to their own derivative,

125
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:30,740
but e along is the special number  so that that proportionality constant is one,

126
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,980
meaning e to the t actually equals its own derivative.

127
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:38,460
One way to think of that is that if you look at the graph of e to the t,

128
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:43,820
it has the peculiar property that the slope of a tangent line to any point on this graph

129
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,900
equals the height of that point above the horizontal axis.

130
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:53,320
The existence of a function like this answers the question of the mystery constants

131
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,220
and it's because it gives a different way to think about functions

132
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,700
that are proportional to their own derivative.

133
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,640
The key is to use the chain rule.

134
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,860
For example,  what is the derivative of e to the 3t?

135
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:06,640
Well,

136
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,880
you take the derivative of the outermost function, which due to this special nature of e

137
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,860
is just itself and then multipliy it by the derivative of that inner function, 3t

138
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,900
which is the constant, 3.

139
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:24,900
Or, rather than just applying a rule blindly, you could take this moment to practice the intuition for the chain rule

140
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:30,820
that I talked through last video, thinking about how a slight nudge to t changes the value of 3t

141
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:36,320
and how that intermediate change nudges the final value of e to the 3t.

142
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,380
Either way, the point is, e to the power of some constant times t

143
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,780
is equal to that same constant times itself.

144
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:56,040
And from here, the question of those mystery constants really just comes down to a certain algebraic manipulation.

145
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,700
The number 2 can also be written as e to the natural log of 2.

146
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,980
There's nothing fancy here, this is just the definition of the natural log,

147
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,200
it asks the question, "e to what equals 2?"

148
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,920
So, the function 2 to the t

149
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:19,780
is the same as the function e to the power of the natural log of 2 times t.

150
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:24,280
And from what we just saw, combining the facts that e to the t is its own derivative

151
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,920
with the chain rule, the derivative of this function is proportional to itself,

152
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:33,560
with a proportionality constant equal to the natural log of 2.

153
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,160
And indeed, if you go plug in the natural log of two to a calculator,

154
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,560
you'll find that it's 0.6931,

155
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,460
the mystery constant that we ran into earlier.

156
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,560
And the same goes for all of the other bases.

157
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,920
The mystery proportionality constant that pops up when taking derivatives

158
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,780
is just the natural log of the base,

159
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:59,680
the answer to the question, "e to the what equals that base?"

160
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:07,500
In fact, throughout applications of calculus, you rarely see exponentials written as some base to a power t,

161
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:13,560
instead you almost always write the exponential as e to the power of some constant times t.

162
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,480
It's all equivalent. I mean any function like 2 to the t

163
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:23,780
or 3 to the t can also be written as e to some constant time t.

164
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,500
At the risk of staying over-focused on the symbols here,

165
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:33,820
Ireally want to emphasize that there are many many ways to write down any particular exponential function,

166
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,240
and when you see something written as e to some constant time t,

167
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,980
that's a choice that we make to write it that way, and the number e is not fundamental to that function itself.

168
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:49,000
What is special about writing exponentials in terms of e like this,

169
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:54,080
is that it gives that constant  in the exponent a nice, readable meaning.

170
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,840
Here, let me show you what I mean.

171
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:02,520
All sorts of natural phenomena involve some rate of change that's proportional to the thing that's changing.

172
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:08,020
For example, the rate of growth of a population actually does tend to be proportional

173
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,180
to the size of the population itself,

174
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,940
assuming there isn't some limited resource slowing things down.

175
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,440
And if you put a cup of hot water in a cool room,

176
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,420
the rate at which the water cools is proportional to the difference in temperature

177
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,620
between the room and the water.

178
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,320
Or, said a little differently

179
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,060
the rate at which that difference changes is proportional to itself.

180
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,380
If you invest your money, the rate at which it grows

181
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,820
is proportional to the amount of money there at any time.

182
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,380
In all of these cases, where some variable's rate of change

183
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,260
is proportional to itself

184
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:50,940
the function describing that variable over time is going to look like some kind of exponential.

185
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,980
And even though there are lots of ways to write any exponential function,

186
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,560
it's very natural to choose to express these functions

187
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,820
as e to the power of some constant times t

188
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,000
since that constant carries a very natural meaning.

189
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,560
It's the same as the proportionality constant between the size of the changing variable

190
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,720
and the rate of change.

191
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,000
And, as always, I want to thank those who have made this series possible.
