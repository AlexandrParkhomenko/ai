1
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:15,519
Let me share with you something I found particularly
weird when I was a student first learning

2
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,830
calculus.
Let’s say you have a circle with radius

3
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:23,860
5 centered at the origin of the xy-coordinate
plane, which is defined using the equation

4
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:31,111
x^2 + y^2 = 5^2. That is, all points on this
circle are a distance 5 from the origin, as

5
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:36,090
encapsulated by the pythagorean theorem with
the sum of the squares of the legs of this

6
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,600
triangle equalling the square of the hypotenuse,
52.

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,160
And suppose you want to find the slope of
a tangent line to this circle, maybe at the

8
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,141
point (x, y) = (3, 4).
Now, if you’re savvy with geometry, you

9
00:00:50,141 --> 00:00:55,220
might already know that this tangent line
is perpendicular to the radius line touching

10
00:00:55,220 --> 00:01:00,040
that point. But let’s say you don’t already
know that, or that you want a technique that

11
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:06,040
generalizes to curves other than circles.
As with other problems about slope of tangent

12
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,640
lines, they key thought here is to zoom in
close enough that the curve basically looks

13
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,030
just like its own tangent line, then ask about
a tiny step along that curve.

14
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,770
The y-component of that little step is what
you might call dy, and the x-component is

15
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:28,549
a little dx, so the slope we’re looking
for is the rise over run dy/dx.

16
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:33,770
But unlike other tangent-slope problems in
calculus, this curve is not the graph of a

17
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:39,719
function, so we cannot take a simple derivative,
asking about the size of a tiny nudge to the

18
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:46,520
output of a function caused by some tiny nudge
to the input. x is not an input and y is not

19
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:53,090
an output in this case, they’re both just
interdependent values related by some equation.

20
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:59,310
This is called an “implicit curve”; it’s
just the set of all points (x, y) that satisfy

21
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,979
some property written in terms of the two
variables x and y.

22
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:12,820
The procedure for finding dy/dx here is what
I found very weird as a calculus student,

23
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,560
you take the derivative of both sides of this
equation like this: For the derivative of

24
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:26,830
x2 you write 2x*dx, similarly y2 becomes 2y*dy,
and the derivative of the constant 52 on the

25
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:32,780
right is 0.
You can see why this feels strange, right?

26
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,501
What does it mean to take a derivative of
an expression with multiple variables? And

27
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:42,640
why are we tacking on the little dy and dx
in this way?

28
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,311
But if you just blindly move forward with
what you get here, you can rearrange to find

29
00:02:48,311 --> 00:02:56,210
an expression for dy/dx, which in this case
comes out to -x/y.

30
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:05,500
So at a point with coordinates (x, y) = (3,
4), that slope would be -¾, evidently.

31
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,680
This strange process is called “implicit
differentiation”. Don’t worry, I have

32
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,310
an explanation for how you can interpret taking
a derivative of an expression with two variables

33
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:19,540
like this.
But first, I want to set aside this particular

34
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:24,930
problem, and show how this is related to a
different type of calculus problem: Related

35
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,930
rates.

36
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:32,220
Imagine a 5 meter long ladder up against a
wall, where the top of the ladder starts of

37
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,960
4 meters above the ground, which, by the pythagorean
theorem, means the bottom is 3 meters away

38
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,580
from the wall.
And say it’s slipping down the wall in such

39
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,790
a way that the top of the ladder is dropping
at 1 meter per second.

40
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:52,260
The question is, in that initial moment, what
is the rate at which the bottom of the ladder

41
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,580
is moving away from the wall.
It’s interesting, right? That distance from

42
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:03,150
the bottom of the ladder to the wall is 100%
determined by the distance between the top

43
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,870
of the ladder and the floor, so we should
have enough information to figure out how

44
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:13,200
the rates of change for each value depend
on each other, but it might not be entirely

45
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,009
clear at first how to relate the two.

46
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:21,220
First thing’s first, it’s always nice
to give names to the quantities we care about.

47
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:27,150
So label the distance from the top of the
ladder to the ground y(t), written as a function

48
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:32,199
of time because it’s changing. Likewise,
label the distance between the bottom of the

49
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:36,449
ladder and the wall x(t).
They key equation here that relates these

50
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:46,370
terms is the pythagorean theorem: x(t)2 +
y(t)2 = 52. What makes this equation powerful

51
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,810
is that it’s true at all points in time.

52
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:57,349
One way to solve this would be to isolate
x(t), figure out what what y(t) must be based

53
00:04:57,349 --> 00:05:04,099
this 1 meter/second drop rate, then take a
derivative of the resulting function; dx/dt,

54
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:07,199
the rate at which x is changing with respect
to time.

55
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,830
And that’s fine; it involves a couple layers
of using the chain rule, and it will definitely

56
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:17,610
work for you. But I want to show a different
way to think about the same thing.

57
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:22,789
This left-hand side of the equation is a function
of time, right? It just so happens to equal

58
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:28,050
a constant, meaning this value evidently doesn’t
change while time passes, but it’s still

59
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:33,789
written as an expression dependent on time
which we can manipulate like any other function

60
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:38,849
with t as an input.
In particular, we can take a derivative of

61
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:45,470
the left hand side, which is a way of saying
“If I let a little bit of time pass, dt,

62
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:51,729
which causes y to slightly decrease, and x
to slightly increase, how much does this expression

63
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:55,320
change”.
On the one hand, we know that derivative should

64
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:00,009
be 0, since this expression equals a constant,
and constants don’t care about your tiny

65
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:05,469
nudge to time, they remain unchanged.
But on the other hand, what do you get by

66
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:13,499
computing the derivative of this left-hand-side?
The derivative of x(t)2 is 2*x(t)*(the derivative

67
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:20,379
of x). That’s the chain rule I talked about
last video. 2x*dx represents the size of a

68
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:26,900
change to x2 caused by a change to x, and
we’re dividing by dt.

69
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:35,539
Likewise, the rate at which y(t)2 is changing
is 2*y(t)*(the derivative of y).

70
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:43,309
Evidently, this whole expression must be zero,
which is equivalent to saying x2+y2 doesn’t

71
00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:49,710
change while the ladder moves.
And at the very start, t=0, the height y(t)

72
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:56,490
is 4 meters, the distance x(t) is 3 meters,
and since the top of the ladder is dropping

73
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:04,569
at a rate of 1 meter per second, that derivative
dy/dt is -1 meters/second.

74
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:09,979
Now this gives us enough information to isolate
the derivative dx/dt, which, when you work

75
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:13,800
it out, is (4/3) meters per second.

76
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:22,440
Now compare this to the problem of finding
the slope of tangent line to the circle. In

77
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:29,689
both cases, we had the equation x2 + y2 = 52,
and in both cases we ended up taking the derivative

78
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:34,580
of each side of this expression.
But for the ladder problem, these expressions

79
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:40,129
were functions of time, so taking the derivative
has a clear meaning: it’s the rate at which

80
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:45,669
this expression changes as time change.
But what makes the circle situation strange

81
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:50,740
is that rather than saying a small amount
of time dt has passed, which causes x and

82
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:57,770
y to change, the derivative has the tiny nudges
dx and dy both just floating free, not tied

83
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:03,669
to some other common variable like time.
Let me show you how you can think about this:

84
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:08,379
Give this expression x2 + y2 a name, maybe
S.

85
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:14,360
S is essentially a function of two variables,
it takes every point (x, y) on the plane and

86
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,729
associates it with a number.
For points on this circle, that number is

87
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:25,230
25. If you step off that circle away from
the center, that value would be bigger. For

88
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:30,270
other points (x, y) closer to the origin,
that value is smaller.

89
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:35,900
What it means to take a derivative of this
expression, a derivative of S, is to consider

90
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:42,210
a tiny change to both these variables, some
tiny change dx to x, and some tiny change

91
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:47,470
dy to y –and not necessarily one that keeps
you on this circle, by the way, it’s just

92
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:56,600
some tiny step in any direction on the xy-plane–
and ask how much the value of S changes. That

93
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:02,210
difference in the value of S, from the original
point to the nudged point, is what I’m writing

94
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:07,230
as “dS”.
For example, in this picture we’re starting

95
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:17,391
at a point where x is 3 and y is 4, and let’s
just say that step dx is... -0.02, and that

96
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:27,440
dy is -0.01. Then the decrease to S, the amount
the x2+y2 changes over that step, will be

97
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:40,450
around 2(3)(-0.02) + 2(4)(-0.01). That’s
what this derivative expression 2x*dx + 2y*dy

98
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:47,960
means, it tells you how much the value x2+y2
changes, as determined by the point (x, y)

99
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:53,410
where you started, and the tiny step (dx,
dy) that you take.

100
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:58,640
As with all things derivative, this is only
an approximation, but it gets more and more

101
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,510
true for smaller and smaller choices of dx
and dy.

102
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:08,310
The key point is that when you restrict yourself
to steps along this circle, you’re essentially

103
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:13,810
saying you want to ensure that this value
S doesn’t change; it starts at a value of

104
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:20,280
25, and you want to keep it at a value of
25; that is, dS should be 0.

105
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:28,640
So setting this expression 2x*dx + 2y*dy equal
to 0 is the condition under which a tiny step

106
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,460
stays on the circle.
Again, this is only an approximation. Speaking

107
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:39,590
more precisely, that condition keeps you on
a tangent line of the circle, not the circle

108
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:45,570
itself, but for tiny enough steps those are
essentially the same thing.

109
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,150
Of course, there’s nothing special about
the expression x2+y2 = 52 here. You could

110
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,600
have some other expression involving x’s
and y’s, representing some other curve,

111
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,689
and taking the derivative of both sides like
this would give you a way to relate dx to

112
00:10:50,689 --> 00:10:52,530
dy for tiny steps along that curve.
It’s always nice to think through more examples,

113
00:10:52,530 --> 00:11:00,870
so consider the expression sin(x)*y2 = x,
which corresponds to many U-shaped curves

114
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:08,000
on the plane. Those curves represent all the
points (x, y) of the plane where the value

115
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:19,170
of sin(x)*y2 equals the value of x.
Now imagine taking some tiny step with components

116
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:25,120
(dx, dy), and not necessarily one that keeps
you on the curve. Taking the derivative of

117
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,860
each side of this equation will tell us how
much the value of that side changes during

118
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,480
this step.
On the left side, the product rule that we

119
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,500
found in the last video tells us that this
should be “left d-right plus right d-left”:

120
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:52,210
sin(x)*(the change to y2), which is 2y*dy,
plus y2*(the change to sin(x)), which is cos(x)*dx.

121
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:59,900
The right side is simply x, so the size of
a change to the value is exactly dx, right?

122
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:04,630
Setting these two sides equal to each other
is a way of saying “whatever your tiny step

123
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:10,490
with coordinates (dx, dy) is, if it’s going
to keep us on this curve, the values of both

124
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:15,800
the left-hand side and the right-hand side
must change by the same amount.” That’s

125
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,320
the only way this top equation can remain
true.

126
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,580
From there, depending on what problem you’re
solving, you could manipulate further with

127
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:33,680
algebra, where perhaps the most common goal
is to find dy divided by dx.

128
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:41,290
As one more example, let me show how you can
use this technique to help find new derivative

129
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,420
formulas.
I’ve mentioned in a footnote video that

130
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:48,980
the derivative of ex is itself, but what about
the derivative of its inverse function the

131
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:54,290
natural log of x?
The graph of ln(x) can be thought of as an

132
00:12:54,290 --> 00:13:02,570
implicit curve; all the points on the xy plane
where y = ln(x), it just happens to be the

133
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:07,570
case that the x’s and y’s of this equation
aren’t as intermingled as they were in other

134
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:13,240
examples.
The slope of this graph, dy/dx, should be

135
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:20,130
the derivative of ln(x), right?
Well, to find that, first rearrange this equation

136
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:28,490
y = ln(x) to be ey = x. This is exactly what
the natural log of x means; it’s saying

137
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:34,441
e to the what equals x.
Since we know the derivative of ey, we can

138
00:13:34,441 --> 00:13:40,510
take the derivative of both sides, effectively
asking how a tiny step with components (dx,

139
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:47,720
dy) changes the value of each side.
To ensure the step stays on the curve, the

140
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:54,470
change to the left side of the equation, which
is ey*dy, must equals the change to the right

141
00:13:54,470 --> 00:14:02,430
side, which is dx.
Rearranging, this means dy/dx, the slope of

142
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:11,200
our graph, equals 1/ey. And when we’re on
this curve, ey is by definition the same as

143
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:18,250
x, so evidently the slope is 1/x.
An expression for the slope of the graph of

144
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:24,820
function in terms of x like this is the derivative
of that function, so evidently the derivative

145
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:33,070
of ln(x) is 1/x.

146
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:38,470
By the way, all of this is a little peek into
multivariable calculus, where you consider

147
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:44,850
functions with multiple inputs, and how they
change as you tweak those inputs.

148
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:50,940
The key, as always, is to have a clear image
in your head of what tiny nudges are at play,

149
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,670
and how exactly they depend on each other.

150
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:58,650
Next up, I’ll talk about about what exactly
a limit is, and how it’s used to formalize

151
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,050
the idea of a derivative.
