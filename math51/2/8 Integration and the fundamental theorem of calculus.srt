1
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:18,130
This guy, Grothendieck, is somewhat of a mathematical
idol to me. And I just love this quote, don’t

2
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,700
you? Too often in math we just dive into showing
that a certain fact is true with long series

3
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:28,160
of formulas before stepping back and making
sure that it feels reasonable, and preferably

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,980
obvious, at least on an intuitive level.
In this video I want to talk about integrals,

5
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,270
and the thing that I want to become “almost
obvious” is that they are an inverse of

6
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:42,360
derivatives.
Here, we’ll focus just on one example, which

7
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,720
is kind of dual to the example of a moving
car that I talked about in chapter 2 of the

8
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,590
series, introducing derivatives.
Then in the next video, we’ll see how the

9
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:55,760
idea generalizes into some other contexts.

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,800
Imagine you’re sitting in a car, and you
can’t see out the window; all you see is

11
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:08,180
the speedometer. At some point, the car starts
moving, speeds up, then slows back down to

12
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:14,080
a stop, all over 8 seconds.
The question is, is there a nice way to figure

13
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,030
out how far you’ve traveled during that
time, based only on your view of the speedometer?

14
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:25,759
Or better yet, find a distance function s(t)
that tells you how far you’ve traveled after

15
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,470
any given amount of time, t, between 0 and
8 seconds.

16
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:36,179
Let’s say you take note of the velocity
at each second, and make a plot over time

17
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:43,149
like this... And maybe you find that a nice
function to model your velocity over time,

18
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:48,829
in meters per second, is v(t) = t(8-t).

19
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:53,270
You might remember, in chapter 2 of this series,
we were looking at the opposite situation,

20
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:58,070
where you know a distance function, s(t),
and you want to figure out a velocity function

21
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:02,310
from that.
I showed how the derivative of your distance

22
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,719
vs. time function gives you a velocity vs.
time function, so in our current situation,

23
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:12,069
where all we know is the velocity function,
it should make sense that finding a distance

24
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:19,490
vs. time function s(t) comes down to asking
what function has a derivative t(8-t).

25
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:23,180
This is often described as finding the anti-derivative
of a function.

26
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,480
And indeed, that’s what we’ll end up doing,
and you could even pause and try that right

27
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,110
now. But first, I want to spend the bulk of
this video showing how this question is related

28
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,560
to finding an area bounded by velocity graph,
because that helps to build an intuition for

29
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:44,180
a whole class of what are called “integral
problems” in math and science.

30
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,920
This question would be much simpler if the
car was moving with a constant velocity, right?

31
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,090
In that case, you could just multiply the
velocity, in meters per second, by the amount

32
00:02:54,090 --> 00:03:00,190
of time passed, in seconds, and that gives
you the number of meters traveled.

33
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:06,430
Notice that you can visualize that distance
as an area, and if visualizing distance as

34
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,120
an area seems weird, I’m right there with
you. It’s just that on this plot, where

35
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,690
the horizontal direction has units of seconds
and the vertical direction has units of meters/second,

36
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:22,090
units of area very naturally correspond to
meters.

37
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,730
But what makes our situation hard is that
the velocity not constant, it’s incessantly

38
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:33,570
changing at every instant. It would even be
a lot easier if it only ever changed at a

39
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:39,230
handful of points, maybe staying static for
the first second, then suddenly discontinuously

40
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:45,090
jumping to a constant 7 meters per second
for the next second, and so on, with discontinuous

41
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:50,760
jumps to portions of constant velocity.
That might make it very uncomfortable for

42
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,930
the driver, in fact, it’s physically impossible,
but it would make your calculations a lot

43
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,710
more straightforward.
You could compute the distance traveled on

44
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:04,680
each interval by multiplying the constant
velocity on that interval by the change in

45
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,900
time. Then just add them all up.
So what we’ll do is just approximate our

46
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,270
velocity function as if it was constant on
a bunch of different intervals.

47
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:20,440
Then, as is common in calculus, we’ll see
how refining that approximation leads us to

48
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,490
something precise.

49
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:30,120
Here, let’s make this more concrete with
some numbers. Chop up the time axis between

50
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:39,320
0 and 8 into many small intervals, each with
some little width dt, like 0.25 seconds.

51
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:45,350
Consider one of these intervals, like the
one between t=1, and 1.25.

52
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:52,200
In reality the car speeds up from 7 m/s to
about 8.4 m/s during that time, which you

53
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:59,560
can find by plugging in t = 1 and 1.25 to
the equation for velocity.

54
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:05,290
We want to approximate the car’s motion
as if its velocity was constant on this interval.

55
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:09,870
Again, the reason for doing that is that we
don’t really know how to handle anything

56
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:15,940
other than a constant velocity situations.
You could choose this constant to be anything

57
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:22,220
between 7 and 8.4, it doesn’t really matter.
All that matters is that that our sequence

58
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:28,389
of approximations, whatever they are, gets
better and better as dt gets smaller and smaller.

59
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:32,591
That treating this car’s journey as a bunch
of discontinuous jumps in speed between small

60
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:38,350
portions of constant velocity becomes a less
wrong reflection of reality as we decrease

61
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:46,370
the time between those jumps.
So for convenience, let’s just approximate

62
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,040
the speed on each interval with whatever the
true car’s velocity is at the start of the

63
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:56,050
interval; the height of the graph above the
left side, which in this case is 7.

64
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:02,450
So on this example interval, according to
our approximation, the car moves (7 m/s)*(0.25

65
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:11,000
s). That’s 1.75 meters, nicely visualized
as the area of this thin rectangle. This is

66
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,930
a little under the real distance traveled,
but not by much.

67
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:21,920
And the same goes for every other interval:
The approximated distance is v(t)*dt, it’s

68
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,910
just that you plug in a different value of
t for each one, giving a different height

69
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,030
for each rectangle.

70
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:34,060
I’m going to write out an expression for
the sum of the areas of all these rectangles

71
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,699
in kind of a funny way.
Take this symbol, which looks like a stretched

72
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:45,080
“S” for sum, then put a 0 at its bottom
and an 8 at its top to indicate that we’re

73
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,870
ranging over time steps between 0 and 8 seconds.
And as I said the amount we’re adding up

74
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:57,830
at each time step is v(t)*dt.
Two things are implicit in this notation:

75
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:04,531
First, the value dt plays two roles: not only
is it a factor in each quantity we’re adding

76
00:07:04,531 --> 00:07:11,050
up, it also indicates the spacing between
each sampled time step. So when you make dt

77
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:16,510
smaller, even though it decreases the area
of each rectangle here, it increases the total

78
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,830
number of rectangles whose areas we’re adding
up.

79
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:27,570
And second, the reason we don’t use the
usual sigma notation to indicate a sum is

80
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:32,870
that this expression is technically not any
particular sum for any particular choice of

81
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:38,970
dt; it’s whatever that sum approaches as
dt approaches 0.

82
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:44,970
As you can see, what that approaches is the
area bounded by this curve and the horizontal

83
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:49,720
axis.
Remember, smaller choices of dt indicate closer

84
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:55,350
approximations for our original question,
how far does the car go, right? So this limiting

85
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:01,470
value for the sum, the area under this curve,
gives the precise answer to the question,

86
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:06,360
in full unapproximated precision.
Now tell me that’s not surprising. We have

87
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,600
this pretty complicated idea of approximations
that can involve adding up a huge number of

88
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:17,690
very tiny things, and yet the value those
approximates approach can be described so

89
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:24,180
simply, as the area under a curve.
This expression is called an “integral”

90
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:29,990
of v(t), since it brings all of its values
together, it integrates them.

91
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:35,750
Now you could say, “How does this help!?.
You’ve just reframed one hard question,

92
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,578
finding how far the car has traveled, into
another equally hard problem, finding the

93
00:08:39,578 --> 00:08:43,129
area between this graph and the horizontal
axis?”

94
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:50,540
And...you’d be right! If the velocity/distance
duo was all we cared about, most of this video

95
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:55,370
with all this area under a curve nonsense
would be a waste of time. We could just skip

96
00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:00,500
straight ahead to figuring out an antiderivative.
But finding the area between a function’s

97
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:06,520
graph and the horizontal axis is somewhat
of a common language for many disparate problems

98
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,649
that can be broken down and approximated as
the sum of a large number of small things.

99
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:16,940
You’ll see more next video, but for now
I’ll just say in the abstract that understanding

100
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:24,080
how interpret and compute the area under a
graph is a very general problem-solving tool.

101
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,870
In fact, the first video of this series already
covered the basics of how this works, but

102
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,500
now that we have more of a background with
derivatives, we can actually take the idea

103
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,310
to its completion.

104
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:42,170
For our velocity example, think of this right
endpoint as a variable, capital T. So we’re

105
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,770
thinking of this integral of the velocity
function between 0 and T, the area under this

106
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:52,550
curve between those two inputs, as a function,
where that upper bound is the variable.

107
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:58,320
That area represents the distance the car
has traveled after T seconds, right? So this

108
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,180
is really a distance vs. time function s(T).
Now ask yourself: What is the derivative of

109
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:09,490
that function?
On the one hand, a tiny change in distance

110
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:15,420
over a tiny change in time is velocity; that’s
what velocity means. But there’s another

111
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:20,880
way to see it purely in terms of this graph
and this area, which generalizes better to

112
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,600
other integral problems.
A slight nudge of dT to the input causes that

113
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,770
area to increase, some little ds represented
by the area of this sliver.

114
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:38,010
The height of that sliver is the height of
the graph at that point, v(T), and its width

115
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:42,300
is dT.
And for small enough dT, we can basically

116
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:48,000
consider that sliver to be a rectangle. So
the area of that sliver, ds, is approximately

117
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,870
equal to v(T)*dT.
Because this approximation gets better and

118
00:10:53,870 --> 00:11:02,600
better for smaller dT, the derivative of the
area function ds/dT at this point equals v(T),

119
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,080
the value of the velocity function at whatever
time we started on.

120
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:12,709
And that’s super general, the derivative
of any function giving the area under a graph

121
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:18,770
like this is equal to the function for the
graph itself.

122
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:26,370
So if our velocity function here is t*(8-t),
what should s be? What function of t has a

123
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,410
derivative t*(8-t). This is where we actually
have to roll up our sleeves and do some math.

124
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:36,420
It’s easier to see if we expand this out
as 8t - t2.

125
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:43,170
Take each part here one at a time: What function
has a derivative 8t? Well, we know that the

126
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:49,990
derivative of t2 is 2t, so if we just scale
that up by 4, we see that the derivative of

127
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:56,570
4t2 is 8t.
And for that second part, what kind of function

128
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:03,080
might have -t2 as its derivative? Using the
power rule again, we know that the derivative

129
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:11,000
of a cubic term, t3, gives a squared term,
3t2, so if we scale that down by a third,

130
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,940
the derivative of (⅓)t3 is exactly t2, and
making that negative we see that -(⅓)t3

131
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:28,089
has a derivative of -t2.
Therefore, the antiderivative of 8t - t2 is

132
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:32,700
4t2 - (⅓)t3.

133
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,660
But there’s a slight issue here: we could
add any constant to this function, and its

134
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:45,170
derivative would still be 8t - t2. The derivative
of a constant is always 0.

135
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:49,600
And if we graph s(t), you can think of this
in the sense that moving a graph of a distance

136
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,640
function up and down does nothing to affect
its slope above each input.

137
00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:01,209
So there are actually infinitely many different
possible antiderivative functions, all of

138
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:08,620
which look like 4t2 - (⅓)t3 + C for some
constant C.

139
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,370
But there is one piece of information we haven’t
used yet that let’s us zero in on which

140
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:18,320
antiderivative to use: The lower bound on
the integral.

141
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:24,110
This integral must be zero when we drag that
right endpoint all the way to the left endpoint,

142
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:31,610
right? The distance traveled by the car between
0 seconds and 0 seconds is...zero.

143
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:37,360
So as we found, this area as a function of
capital T is an antiderivative for the stuff

144
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:45,279
inside, and to choose what constant to add,
subtract off the value of that antiderivative

145
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:50,470
function at the lower bound.
If you think about it for a moment, that ensures

146
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:57,790
that the integral from the lower bound to
itself will indeed be 0.

147
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:04,200
As it so happens, when you evaluate the function
we have here at t=0, you get zero, so in this

148
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,029
specific case you don’t actually need to
subtract off anything.

149
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:14,010
For example, the total distance traveled during
the 8 seconds is this expression evaluated

150
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:24,959
at T=8, which is 85.33, minus 0.
But a more typical example would be something

151
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:30,750
like this integral between 1 and 7. That’s
the area pictured here, and it represents

152
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:36,640
the distance traveled between 1 second and
7 seconds.

153
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:42,321
What you’d do is evaluate the antiderivative
we found at the top bound, 7, and subtract

154
00:14:42,321 --> 00:14:49,269
off its value at the bottom bound, 1.
Notice, it doesn’t matter what antiderivative

155
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:55,149
we choose here; if for some reason it had
a constant added to it, like 5, that constant

156
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:58,269
would cancel out.

157
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:03,360
More generally, anytime you want to integrate
some function –and remember you think of

158
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:10,350
as adding up the values f(x)*dx for inputs
in a certain range then asking what that sum

159
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:19,070
approaches as dx approaches 0– the first
step is to find an antiderivative, some other

160
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:24,920
function, “capital F(x)”, whose derivative
is the thing inside the integral.

161
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:30,899
Then the integral equals this antiderivative
evaluated at the top bound, minus its value

162
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:38,070
at the bottom bound. This fact is called the
“fundamental theorem of calculus”.

163
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:44,730
Here’s what’s crazy about this fact: The
integral, the limiting value for the sum of

164
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:50,410
all these thin rectangles, takes into account
every single input on the continuum from the

165
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:54,960
lower bound to the upper bound, that’s why
we use the word “integrate”; it brings

166
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:02,100
them together. And yet, to actually compute
it using the antiderivative, you look at only

167
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:08,670
two inputs: the top and the bottom.
It almost feels like cheating! Finding the

168
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:13,730
antiderivative implicitly accounts for all
the information needed to add up all the values

169
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:17,760
between the lower bound and upper bound.

170
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:24,180
There’s kind of a lot packed into this whole
concept, so let’s recap everything that

171
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,970
just happened, shall we?
We wanted to figure out how far a car goes

172
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:34,089
just by looking at the speedometer, and what
makes that hard is that the velocity was always

173
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:37,940
changing.
If you approximate it to be constant on multiple

174
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:42,829
different intervals, you can figure out how
far the car goes on each interval just with

175
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:44,510
multiplication, then add them all up.
Adding up those products can be visualized

176
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,529
as the sum of the areas of many thin rectangles
like this.

177
00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:51,579
Better and better approximations of the original
problem correspond to collections of rectangles

178
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:57,250
whose aggregate area is closer and closer
to being the area under this curve between

179
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:04,240
the start time and end time, so that area
under the curve is the precise distance traveled

180
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:11,751
for the true, nowhere-constant velocity function.
If you think of this area as function, with

181
00:17:11,751 --> 00:17:18,040
a variable right end point, you can deduce
that the derivative of that area function

182
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:24,470
must equal the height of the graph at each
point. That’s the key! So to find a function

183
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:30,740
giving this area, you ask what function has
v(t) as its derivative.

184
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:35,270
There are actually infinitely many antiderivatives
of a given function, since you can always

185
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:40,330
just add some constant without affecting the
derivative, so you account for that by subtracting

186
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:46,700
off the value of whatever antiderivative function
you choose at the bottom bound.

187
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:53,160
By the way, one important thing to bring up
before leaving is the idea of negative area.

188
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,360
What if our velocity function was negative
at some point? Meaning the car is going backwards.

189
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:04,320
It’s still true that the tiny distance traveled
ds on a little time interval is about equal

190
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:10,580
to the velocity times the tiny change in time,
it’s just that that the number you’d plug

191
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:16,799
in for velocity would be negative, so that
tiny change in distance is negative.

192
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:22,660
In terms of our thin rectangles, if the rectangle
goes below the horizontal axis like this,

193
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:29,021
its area represents a bit of distance traveled
backwards, so if what you want is to find

194
00:18:29,021 --> 00:18:35,169
the distance between the car’s start point
and end point, you’d want to subtract it.

195
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:41,660
And this is generally true of integrals: Whenever
a graph dips below the horizontal axis, that

196
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:50,169
area underneath is counted as negative.
What you’ll commonly hear is that integrals

197
00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:56,020
measure the “signed” area between a graph
and the horizontal axis.

198
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,910
Next up I’ll bring up more contexts where
this idea of an integral and the area under

199
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:05,650
curves comes up, along with some other intuitions
for the fundamental theorem of calculus.

200
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:11,549
Perhaps you remember, chapter 2 of this series,
introducing the derivative was sponsored by

201
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:16,380
the Art of Problem Solving. So I think there’s
something elegant to the fact that this video,

202
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:22,140
which is kind of a dual to that one, was also
supported in part by the Art of Problem Solving.

203
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,190
I really can’t imagine a better sponsor
for the channel, because it’s a company

204
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,460
whose books and courses I recommend to people
anyway.

205
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,059
They were highly influential to me, when I
was a student developing a love for creative

206
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:38,730
math, so if you’re a parent looking to foster
your own child’s love for the subject, or

207
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:43,309
if you’re a student who wants to see what
math has to offer beyond rote school work,

208
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:46,780
I cannot recommend the Art of Problem Solving
enough.

209
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,420
Whether that’s their newest development
to build the right intuitions in elementary

210
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:55,820
schools kids, called Beast academy, or their
courses on higher level topics and contest

211
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:01,429
preparation.

00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:05,690
the link on the screen, lets them know you
came from this channel, which may encourage

213
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,650
them to support future projects like this
one.

214
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:13,790
I consider these videos a success not when
they teach people a particular bit of math,

215
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:18,490
which can only ever be a drop in the ocean,
but when they encourage people to go explore

216
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:23,490
the expanse of math for themselves. And the
Art of Problem Solving is among the few great

217
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:26,040
places to actually do that.
