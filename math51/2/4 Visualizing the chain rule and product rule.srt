1
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,850
In the last videos I talked about the derivatives
of simple functions, things like powers of

2
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,230
x, sin(x), and exponentials, the goal being
to have a clear picture or intuition to hold

3
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,610
in your mind that explains where these formulas
come from.

4
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:32,439
Most functions you use to model the world
involve mixing, combining and tweaking these

5
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:38,390
these simple functions in some way; so our
goal now is to understand how to take derivatives

6
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:45,510
of more complicated combinations; where again,
I want you to have a clear picture in mind

7
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,500
for each rule.

8
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,239
This really boils down into three basic ways
to combine functions together: Adding them,

9
00:00:55,239 --> 00:01:00,300
multiplying them, and putting one inside the
other; also known as composing them.

10
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,920
Sure, you could say subtracting them, but
that’s really just multiplying the second

11
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,350
by -1, then adding.

12
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:14,220
Likewise, dividing functions is really just
the same as plugging one into the function

13
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,430
1/x, then multiplying.

14
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:23,369
Most functions you come across just involve
layering on these three types of combinations,

15
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:27,250
with no bound on how monstrous things can
become.

16
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,560
But as long as you know how derivatives play
with those three types of combinations, you

17
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,049
can always just take it step by step and peal
through the layers.

18
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:44,299
So, the question is, if you know the derivatives
of two functions, what is the derivative of

19
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:50,530
their sum, of their product, and of the function
compositions between them?

20
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:56,150
The sum rule is the easiest, if somewhat tounge-twisting
to say out loud: The derivative of a sum of

21
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,909
two functions is the sum of their derivatives.

22
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,619
But it’s worth warming up with this example
by really thinking through what it means to

23
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:09,840
take a derivative of a sum of two functions,
since the derivative patterns for products

24
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,400
and function composition won’t be so straight
forward, and will require this kind of deeper

25
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,860
thinking.

26
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:24,949
The function f(x) = sin(x) + x2 is a function
where, for every input, you add together the

27
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:30,130
values of sin(x) and x2 at that point.

28
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:38,600
For example, at x = 0.5, the height of the
sine graph is given by this bar, the height

29
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:46,669
of the x2 parabola is given by this bar, and
their sum is the length you get by stacking

30
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:48,769
them together.

31
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:53,919
For the derivative, you ask what happens as
you nudge the input slightly, maybe increasing

32
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,609
it to 0.5+dx.

33
00:02:57,609 --> 00:03:03,390
The difference in the value of f between these
two values is what we call df.

34
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:09,550
Well, pictured like this, I think you’ll
agree that the total change in height is whatever

35
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:16,230
the change to the sine graph is, what we might
call d(sin(x)), plus whatever the change to

36
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:23,060
x2 is, d(x2).

37
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:29,280
We know the derivative of sine is cosine,
and what that means is that this little change

38
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,120
d(sin(x)) would be about cos(x)dx.

39
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:40,370
It’s proportional to the size of dx, with
a proportionality constant equal to cosine

40
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,650
of whatever input we started at.

41
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:50,370
Similarly, because the derivative of x2 is
2x, the change in the height of the x2 graph

42
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,900
is about 2x*dx.

43
00:03:53,900 --> 00:04:03,630
So, df/dx, the ratio of the tiny change to
the sum function to the tiny change in x that

44
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:11,650
caused it, is indeed cos(x)+2x, the sum of
the derivatives of its parts.

45
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,470
But like I said, things are a bit different
for products.

46
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:20,120
Let’s think through why, in terms of tiny
nudges.

47
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,880
In this case, I don’t think graphs are our
best bet for visualizing things.

48
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,680
Pretty commonly in math, all levels of math
really, if you’re dealing with a product

49
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,100
of two things, it helps to try to understand
it as some form of area.

50
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,630
In this case, you might try to configure some
mental setup of a box whose side-lengths are

51
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,410
sin(x) and x2.

52
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,840
What would that mean?

53
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,310
Well, since these are functions, you might
think of these sides as adjustable; dependent

54
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,660
on the value of x, which you might think of
as a number that you can freely adjust.

55
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:59,070
So, just getting the feel for this, focus
on that top side, whose changes as the function

56
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,160
sin(x).

57
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:07,630
As you change the value of x up from 0, it
increases in up to a length of 1 as sin(x)

58
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,810
moves towards its peak.

59
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:15,320
After that, it starts decreasing as sin(x)
comes down from 1.

60
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,480
And likewise, that height changes as x2.

61
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:27,320
So f(x), defined as this product, is the area
of this box.

62
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:34,430
For the derivative, think about how a tiny
change to x by dx influences this area; that

63
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,630
resulting change in area is df.

64
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:46,080
That nudge to x causes the width to change
by some small d(sin(x)), and the height to

65
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,880
change by some d(x2).

66
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,590
This gives us three little snippets of new
area: A thin rectangle on the bottom, whose

67
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:02,780
area is its width, sin(x), times its thin
height, d(x2); there’s a thin rectangle

68
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:11,020
on the right, whose area is its height, x2,
times its thin width, d(sin(x)).

69
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,960
And there’s also bit in the corner.

70
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:20,400
But we can ignore it, since its area will
ultimately be proportional to dx2, which becomes

71
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,230
negligible as dx goes to 0.

72
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:29,750
This is very similar to what I showed last
video, with the x2 diagram.

73
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:34,740
Just like then, keep in mind that I’m using
somewhat beefy changes to draw things, so

74
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:43,080
we can see them, but in principle think of
dx as very very small, meaning d(x2) and d(sin(x))

75
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,200
are also very very small.

76
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:53,020
Applying what we know about the derivative
of sine and x2, that tiny change d(x2) is

77
00:06:53,020 --> 00:07:04,340
2x*dx, and that tiny change d(sin(x)) is cos(x)dx.

78
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:13,930
Dividing out by that dx, the derivative df/dx
is sin(x) by the derivative of x2, plus x2

79
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:21,600
by the derivative of sine.

80
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:29,100
This line of reasoning works for any two functions.

81
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,920
A common mnemonic for the product rule is
to say in your head “left d right, right

82
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,120
d left”.

83
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:41,040
In this example, sin(x)*x2, “left d right”
means you take the left function, in this

84
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,530
case sin(x), times the derivative of the right,
x2, which gives 2x.

85
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:51,230
Then you add “right d left”: the right
function, x2, times the derivative of the

86
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,230
left, cos(x).

87
00:07:52,230 --> 00:08:02,750
Out of context, this feels like kind of a
strange rule, but when you think of this adjustable

88
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,630
box you can actually see how those terms represent
slivers of area.

89
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:13,669
“Left d right” is the area of this bottom
rectangle, and “right d left” is the area

90
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:20,300
of this rectangle on the right.

91
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:26,090
By the way, I should mention that if you multiply
by a constant, say 2*sin(x), things end up

92
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,300
much simpler.

93
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,250
The derivative is just that same constant
times the derivative of the function, in this

94
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,510
case 2*cos(x).

95
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:42,078
I’ll leave it to you to pause and ponder
to verify that this makes sense.

96
00:08:42,078 --> 00:08:47,490
Aside from addition and multiplication, the
other common way to combine functions that

97
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:53,250
comes up all the time is function composition.

98
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:58,440
For example, let’s say we take the function
x2, and shove it on inside sin(x) to get a

99
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,040
new function, sin(x2).

100
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,680
What’s the derivative of this new function?

101
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:10,890
Here I’ll choose yet another way to visualize
things, just to emphasize that in creative

102
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,830
math, we have lots of options.

103
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,690
I’ll put up three number lines.

104
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:22,120
The top one will hold the value of x, the
second one will represent the value of x2,

105
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,510
and that third line will hold the value of
sin(x2).

106
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:31,700
That is, the function x2 gets you from line
1 to line 2, and the function sine gets you

107
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,940
from line 2 to line 3.

108
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:42,270
As I shift that value of x, maybe up to the
value 3, then value on the second shifts to

109
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,380
whatever x2 is, in this case 9.

110
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:55,360
And that bottom value, being the sin(x2),
will go over to whatever the sin(9) is.

111
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,660
So for the derivative, let’s again think
of nudging that x-value by some little dx,

112
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,600
and I always think it’s helpful to think
of x starting as some actual number, maybe

113
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,900
1.5.

114
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:15,270
The resulting nudge to this second value,
the change to x2 caused by such a dx, is what

115
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,890
we might call d(x2).

116
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:26,400
You can expand this as 2x*dx, which for our
specific input that length would be 2*(1.5)*dx,

117
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:31,149
but it helps to keep it written as d(x2) for
now.

118
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:40,740
In fact let me go one step further and give
a new name to x2, maybe h, so this nudge d(x2)

119
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,820
is just dh.

120
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:47,540
Now think of that third value, which is pegged
at sin(h).

121
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:55,180
It’s change d(sin(h)); the tiny change caused
by the nudge dh.

122
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:00,610
By the way, the fact that it’s moving left
while the dh bump is to the right just means

123
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:05,930
that this change d(sin(h)) is some negative
number.

124
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:15,490
Because we know the derivative of sine, we
can expand d(sin(h)) as cos(h)*dh; that’s

125
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:19,870
what it means for the derivative of sine to
be cosine.

126
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:26,080
Unfolding things, replacing h with x2 again,
that bottom nudge is cos(x2)d(x2).

127
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:36,980
And we could unfold further, noting that d(x2)
is 2x*dx.

128
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:44,410
And it’s always good to remind yourself
of what this all actually means.

129
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:51,890
In this case where we started at x = 1.5 up
top, this means that the size of that nudge

130
00:11:51,890 --> 00:12:04,111
on the third line is about cos(1.52)*2(1.5)*(the
size of dx); proportional to the size of dx,

131
00:12:04,111 --> 00:12:11,420
where the derivative here gives us that proportionality
constant.

132
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:17,570
Notice what we have here, we have the derivative
of the outside function, still taking in the

133
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:25,050
unaltered inside function, and we multiply
it by the derivative of the inside function.

134
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:29,790
Again, there’s nothing special about sin(x)
and x2.

135
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:37,120
If you have two functions g(x) and h(x), the
derivative of their composition function g(h(x))

136
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:47,580
is the derivative of g, evaluated at h(x),
times the derivative of h.

137
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,920
This is what we call the “chain rule”.

138
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:58,800
Notice, for the derivative of g, I’m writing
it as dg/dh instead of dg/dx.

139
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:05,680
On the symbolic level, this serves as a reminder
that you still plug in the inner function

140
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,830
to this derivative.

141
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:11,380
But it’s also an important reflection of
what this derivative of the outer function

142
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,010
actually represents.

143
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:18,790
Remember, in our three-lines setup, when we
took the derivative of sine on the bottom,

144
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:24,900
we expanded the size of the nudge d(sin) as
cos(h)*dh.

145
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,250
This was because we didn’t immediately know
how the size of that bottom nudge depended

146
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:34,700
on x, that’s kind of the whole thing we’re
trying to figure out, but we could take the

147
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,040
derivative with respect to the intermediate
variable h.

148
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:45,760
That is, figure out how to express the size
of that nudge as multiple of dh.

149
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:53,410
Then it unfolded by figuring out what dh was.

150
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:57,970
So in this chain rule expression, we’re
saying look at the ratio between a tiny change

151
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:03,600
in g, the final output, and a tiny change
in h that caused it, h being the value that

152
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,180
we’re plugging into g.

153
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:10,870
Then multiply that by the tiny change in h
divided by the tiny change in x that caused

154
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,160
it.

155
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,800
The dh’s cancel to give the ratio between
a tiny change in the final output, and the

156
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,149
tiny change to the input that, through a certain
chain of events, brought it about.

157
00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:29,110
That cancellation of dh is more than just
a notational trick, it’s a genuine reflection

158
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:36,620
of the tiny nudges that underpin calculus.

159
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,560
So those are the three basic tools in your
belt to handle derivatives of functions that

160
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:47,589
combine many smaller things: The sum rule,
the product rule and the chain rule.

161
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:54,070
I should say, there’s a big difference between
knowing what the chain rule and product rules

162
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:58,080
are, and being fluent with applying them in
even the most hairy of situations.

163
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,820
I said this at the start of the series, but
it’s worth repeating: Watching videos, any

164
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:06,820
videos, about these mechanics of calculus
will never substitute for practicing them

165
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:10,820
yourself, and building the muscles to do these
computations yourself.

166
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:15,940
I wish I could offer to do that for you, but
I’m afraid the ball is in your court, my

167
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,260
friend, to seek out practice.

168
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:24,100
What I can offer, and what I hope I have offered,
is to show you where these rules come from,

169
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,790
to show that they’re not just something
to be memorized and hammered away; but instead

170
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:33,320
are natural patterns that you too could have
discovered by just patiently thinking through
