1
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,480
The goal here is simple: Explain what a derivative
is.

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,279
Thing is, though, there’s some subtlely
to this topic, and some potential for paradoxes

3
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,570
if you’re not careful, so the secondary
goal is that you have some appreciation for

4
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,430
what those paradoxes are and how to avoid
them.

5
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:35,340
You see, it’s common for people to say that
the derivative measures “instantaneous rate

6
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,660
of change”, but if you think about it, that
phrase is actually an oxymoron: Change is

7
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,040
something that happens between separate points
in time, and when you blind yourself to all

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,120
but a single instant, there is no more room
for change.

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,520
You’ll see what I mean as we get into it,
and when you appreciate that a phrase like

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,800
“instantaneous rate of change” is nonsensical,
it makes you appreciate how clever the fathers

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,940
of calculus were in capturing the idea this
phrase is meant to evoke with a perfectly

12
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,590
sensible piece of math: The derivative.

13
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:13,460
As our central example, imagine a car that
starts at some point A, speeds up, then slows

14
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:19,600
to a stop at some point B 100 meters away,
all over the course of 10 seconds.

15
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,490
This is the setup I want you to keep in mind
while I lay out what exactly a derivative

16
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,630
is.

17
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,250
We could graph this motion, letting a vertical
axis represent the distance traveled, and

18
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:35,960
a horizontal axis represent time.

19
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,759
At each time t, represented with a point on
the horizontal axis, the height of the graph

20
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,300
tells us how far the car has traveled after
that amount of time.

21
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,230
It’s common to name a distance function
like this s(t).

22
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:54,770
I’d use the letter d for distance, except
that it already has another full time job

23
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,460
in calculus.

24
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,330
Initially this curve is quite shallow, since
the car is slow at the start.

25
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:05,390
During the first second, the distance traveled
by the car hardly changes at all.

26
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,729
For the next few seconds, as the car speeds
up, the distance traveled in a given second

27
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:14,841
gets larger, corresponding to a steeper slope
in the graph.

28
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:21,129
And as it slows towards the end, the curve
shallows out again.

29
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:26,160
If we were to plot the car’s velocity in
meters per second as a function of time, it

30
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,260
might look like this bump.

31
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,560
At time t=0, the velocity is 0.

32
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,960
Up to the middle of the journey, the car builds
up to some maximum velocity, covering a relatively

33
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,960
large distance in each second.

34
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,890
Then it slows back down to a speed of 0 meters
per second.

35
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:46,920
These two curves are highly related to each
other; if you change the specific distance

36
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,920
vs. time function, you’ll have some different
velocity vs. time function.

37
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,100
We want to understand the specifics of this
relationship.

38
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:01,040
Exactly how does velocity depend on this distance
vs. time function.

39
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:08,090
It’s worth taking a moment to think critically
about what velocity actually means here.

40
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:12,650
Intuitively, we all know what velocity at
a given moment means, it’s whatever the

41
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,840
car’s speedometer shows in that moment.

42
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,320
And intuitively, it might make sense that
velocity should be higher at times when the

43
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,710
distance function is steeper; when the car
traverses more distance per unit time.

44
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:31,050
But the funny thing is, velocity at a single
moment makes no sense.

45
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:36,530
If I show you a picture of a car, a snapshot
in an instant, and ask you how fast it’s

46
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,810
going, you’d have no way of telling me.

47
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,700
What you need are two points in time to compare,
perhaps comparing the distance traveled after

48
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,700
4 seconds to the distance traveled after 5
second.

49
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:49,150
That way, you can take the change in distance
over the change in time.

50
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,150
Right?

51
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:55,770
That’s what velocity is, the distance traveled
over a given amount of time.

52
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:00,240
So how is it that we’re looking at a function
for velocity that only takes in a single value

53
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,480
for t, a single snapshot in time.

54
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,550
It’s weird, isn’t it?

55
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:09,569
We want to associate each individual point
in time with a velocity, but computing velocity

56
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:15,050
requires comparing two points in time.

57
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,589
If that feels strange and paradoxical, good!

58
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:21,919
You’re grappling with the same conflict
that the fathers of calculus did, and if you

59
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,389
want a deep understanding of rates of change,
not just for a moving car, but for all sorts

60
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:32,720
of scenarios in science, you’ll need a resolution
to this apparent paradox.

61
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,770
First let’s talk about the real world, then
we’ll go into a purely mathematical one.

62
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,310
Think about what an actual car’s speedometer
might be doing.

63
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,680
At some point, say 3 seconds into the journey,
the speedometer might measure how far the

64
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,940
car goes in a very small amount of time, perhaps
the distance traveled between 3 seconds and

65
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,600
3.01 seconds.

66
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,430
Then it would compute the speed in meters
per second as that tiny distance, in meters,

67
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,900
divided by that tiny time, 0.01 seconds.

68
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,580
That is, a physical car can sidestep the paradox
by not actually computing speed at a single

69
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:12,510
point in time, and instead computing speed
during very small amounts of time.

70
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:18,960
Let’s call that difference in time “dt”,
which you might think of as 0.01 seconds,

71
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,470
and call the resulting difference in distance
traveled “ds”.

72
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:29,070
So the velocity at that point in time is ds
over dt, the tiny change in distance over

73
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,220
the tiny change in time.

74
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:38,630
Graphically, imagine zooming in on the point
of the distance vs. time graph above t=3.

75
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:44,800
That dt is a small step to the right, since
time is on the horizontal axis, and that ds

76
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,680
is the resulting change in the height of the
graph, since the vertical axis represents

77
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,290
distance traveled.

78
00:05:51,290 --> 00:06:00,669
So ds/dt is the rise-over-run slope between
two very close points on the graph.

79
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:05,110
Of course, there’s nothing special about
the value t=3, we could apply this to any

80
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:11,460
other point in time, so we consider this expression
ds/dt to be a function of t, something where

81
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,360
I can give you some time t, and you can give
back to me the value of this ratio at that

82
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,900
time; the velocity as a function of time.

83
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,112
So for example, when I had the computer draw
this bump curve here representing the velocity

84
00:06:23,112 --> 00:06:25,199
function, the one you can think of as the
slope of this distance vs. time function at

85
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:31,870
each point, here’s what I had computer do:
First, I chose some small value for dt, like

86
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,870
0.01.

87
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:39,330
Then, I had the computer look at many times
t between 0 and 10, and compute the distance

88
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:46,360
function s at (t + dt), minus the value of
this function at t.

89
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,790
That is, the difference in the distance traveled
between the given time t, and the time 0.01

90
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,650
seconds after that.

91
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:59,900
Then divide that difference by the change
in time dt, and this gives the velocity in

92
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,780
meters per second around each point in time.

93
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,139
With this formula, you can give the computer
any curve representing the distance function

94
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:13,690
s(t), and it can figure out the curve representing
the velocity v(t).

95
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:18,320
So now would be a good time to pause, reflect,
make sure this idea of relating distance to

96
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,199
velocity by looking at tiny changes in time
dt makes sense, because now we’re going

97
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:27,750
to tackle the paradox of the derivative head-on.

98
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:34,151
This idea of ds/dt, a tiny change in the value
of the function s divided by a tiny change

99
00:07:34,151 --> 00:07:39,020
in the input t, is almost what the derivative
is.

100
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:43,830
Even though out car’s speedometer will look
at an actual change in time like 0.01 seconds

101
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,960
to compute speed, and even though my program
here for finding a velocity function given

102
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,370
a position function also uses a concrete value
of dt, in pure math, the derivative is not

103
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,130
this ratio ds/dt for any specific choice of
dt.

104
00:07:55,130 --> 00:08:02,479
It is whatever value that ratio approaches
as the choice for dt approaches 0

105
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:10,250
Visually, asking what this ratio approaches
has really a nice meaning: For any specific

106
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:16,060
choice of dt, this ratio ds/dt is the slope
of a line passing through two points on the

107
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,500
graph, right?

108
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:24,710
Well, as dt approaches 0, and those two points
approach each other, the slope of that line

109
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:29,490
approaches the slope of a line tangent to
the graph at whatever point t we’re looking

110
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,639
at.

111
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,190
So the true, honest to goodness derivative,
is not the rise-over-run slope between two

112
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:40,240
nearby points on the graph; it’s equal to
the slope of a line tangent to the graph at

113
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,610
a single point.

114
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,540
Notice what I’m not saying: I’m not saying
that the derivative is whatever happens when

115
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:53,139
dt is infinitely small, nor am I saying that
you plug in 0 for dt.

116
00:08:53,139 --> 00:09:03,879
This dt is always a finitely small, nonzero
value, it’s just approaching 0 is all.

117
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:10,050
So even though change in an instant makes
no sense, this idea of letting dt approach

118
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:15,660
0 is a really clever backdoor way to talk
reasonably about the rate of change at a single

119
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,660
point in time.

120
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,139
Isn’t that neat?

121
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:22,839
It’s flirting with the paradox of change
in an instant without ever needing to touch

122
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:23,839
it.

123
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,699
And it comes with such a nice visual intuition
as the slope of a tangent line at a single

124
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:29,930
point on this graph.

125
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,949
Since change in an instant still makes no
sense, I think it’s healthiest for you to

126
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:39,639
think of this slope not as some “instantaneous
rate of change”, but as the best constant

127
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:43,029
approximation for rate of change around a
point.

128
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:47,420
It’s worth saying a few words on notation
here.

129
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:52,040
Throughout this video I’ve been using “dt”
to refer to a tiny change in t with some actual

130
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:57,129
size, and “ds” to refer to the resulting
tiny change in s, which again has an actual

131
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,420
size.

132
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,720
This is because that’s how I want you to
think about them.

133
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,740
But the convention in calculus is that whenever
you’re using the letter “d” like this,

134
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,970
you’re announcing that the intention is
to eventually see what happens as dt approaches

135
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:11,970
0.

136
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:17,459
For example, the honest-to-goodness derivative
of the function s(t) is written as ds/dt,

137
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:21,959
even though the derivative is not a fraction,
per se, but whatever that fraction approaches

138
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,600
for smaller and smaller nudges in t.

139
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,259
A specific example should help here.

140
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:32,379
You might think that asking about what this
ratio approaches for smaller and smaller values

141
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:37,209
of dt would make it much more difficult to
compute, but strangely it actually makes things

142
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:38,209
easier.

143
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:43,490
Let’s say a given distance vs. time function
was exactly t3.

144
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:50,639
So after 1 second, the car has traveled 13=1
meters, after 2 seconds, it’s traveled 23=8

145
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:52,410
meters, and so on.

146
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:57,189
What I’m about to do might seem somewhat
complicated, but once the dust settles it

147
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:01,940
really is simpler, and it’s the kind of
thing you only ever have to do once in calculus.

148
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:10,119
Let’s say you want the velocity, ds/dt,
at a specific time, like t=2.

149
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:17,009
And for now, think of dt having an actual
size; we’ll let it go to 0 in just a bit.

150
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:26,889
The tiny change in distance between 2 seconds
and 2+dt seconds is s(2+dt)-s(2), and we divide

151
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:28,829
by dt.

152
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:34,559
Since s(t) = t3, that numerator is (2+dt)3
- 23.

153
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,009
Now this, we can work out algebraically.

154
00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:43,089
And again bear with me, there’s a reason
I’m showing you the details.

155
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:49,329
Expanding the top gives 23 + 3*22dt + 3*2*(dt)2
+ (dt)3 - 23.

156
00:11:49,329 --> 00:12:02,149
There are several terms here, and I want you
to remember that it looks like a mess, but

157
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:03,369
it simplifies.

158
00:12:03,369 --> 00:12:07,009
Those 23 terms cancel out.

159
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:15,191
Everything remaining has a dt, so we can divide
that out.

160
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:23,999
So the ratio ds/dt has boiled down to 3*22
+ two different terms that each have a dt

161
00:12:23,999 --> 00:12:25,600
in them.

162
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,560
So as dt approaches 0, representing the idea
of looking at smaller and smaller changes

163
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,239
in time, we can ignore those!

164
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:42,019
By eliminating the need to think of a specific
dt, we’ve eliminated much of the complication

165
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:43,119
in this expression!

166
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:47,310
So what we’re left with is a nice clean
3*22.

167
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:55,110
This means the slope of a line tangent to
the point at t=2 on the graph of t3 is exactly

168
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,819
3*22, or 12.

169
00:12:56,819 --> 00:13:03,040
Of course, there was nothing special about
choosing t=2; more generally we’d say the

170
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,660
derivative of t3, as a function of t, is 3*t2.

171
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,139
That’s beautiful.

172
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:18,360
This derivative is a crazy complicated idea:
We’ve got tiny changes in distance over

173
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,639
tiny changes in time, but instead of looking
at any specific tiny change in time we start

174
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,339
talking about what this thing approaches.

175
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:27,739
I mean, it’s a lot to think about.

176
00:13:27,739 --> 00:13:31,850
Yet we’ve come out with such a simple expression:
3t2.

177
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:36,449
In practice, you would not go through all
that algebra each time.

178
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:41,619
Knowing that the derivative t3 is 3t2 is one
of those things all calculus students learn

179
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:44,410
to do immediately without rederiving each
time.

180
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:48,930
And in the next video, I’ll show ways to
think about this and many other derivative

181
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:52,920
formulas in nice geometric ways.

182
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,889
The point I want to make by showing you the
guts here is that when you consider the change

183
00:13:57,889 --> 00:14:04,110
in distance of a change in time for any specific
value of dt, you’d have a whole mess of

184
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,359
algebra riding along.

185
00:14:05,359 --> 00:14:10,490
But by considering what this ratio approaches
as dt approaches 0, it lets you ignore much

186
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:18,569
of that mess, and actually simplifies the
problem.

187
00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:22,459
Another reason I wanted to show you a concrete
derivative like this is that it gives a good

188
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:27,569
example for the kind of paradox that come
about when you believe in the illusion of

189
00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:30,129
an instantaneous rate of change.

190
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:35,269
Think about this car traveling according to
this t3 distance function, and consider its

191
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:39,720
motion at moment t=0.

192
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,939
Now ask yourself whether or not the car is
moving at that time.

193
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:50,259
On the one hand, we can compute its speed
at that point using the derivative of this

194
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:53,570
function, 3t2, which is 0 at time t=0.

195
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:59,870
Visually, this means the tangent line to the
graph at that point is perfectly flat, so

196
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:05,939
the car’s quote unquote “instantaneous
velocity” is 0, which suggests it’s not

197
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:06,939
moving.

198
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:11,929
But on the other hand, if it doesn’t start
moving at time 0, when does it start moving?

199
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:18,759
Really, pause and ponder this for a moment,
is that car moving at t=0?

200
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:24,319
Do you see the paradox?

201
00:15:24,319 --> 00:15:28,709
The issue is that the question makes no sense,
it references the idea of of change in a moment,

202
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:30,100
which doesn’t exist.

203
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,579
And that’s just not what the derivative
measures.

204
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:37,420
What it means for the derivative of the distance
function to be 0 at this point is that the

205
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:42,829
best constant approximation for the car’s
velocity around that point is 0 meters per

206
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:44,129
second.

207
00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:53,879
For example, between t=0 and t=0.1 seconds,
the car does move... it moves 0.001 meters.

208
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:59,739
That’s very small, and importantly it’s
very small compared to the change in time,

209
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:05,079
an average speed of only 0.01 meters per second.

210
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:09,889
What it means for the derivative of this motion
to be 0 is that for smaller and smaller nudges

211
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:13,990
in time, this ratio of change in distance
over change in time approaches 0, though in

212
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,990
this case it never actually hits it.

213
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,879
But that’s not to say the car is static.

214
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:24,389
Approximating its movement with a constant
velocity of 0, after all, just an approximation.

215
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:28,509
So if you ever hear someone refer to the derivative
as an “instantaneous rate of change”,

216
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:34,339
a phrase which is intrinsically oxymoronic,
think of it as a conceptual shorthand for

217
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:39,179
“the best constant approximation for the
rate of change”

218
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:42,679
In the following videos I’ll talk more about
the derivative; what does it look like in

219
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:46,639
different contexts, how do you actually compute
it, what’s it useful for, things like that,
