00:00:04,478 --> 00:00:06,020
CHRISTOPHER POTTS:
Welcome, everyone.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,320
This is part 4 of our series
on presenting your research.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,153
We're going to be talking
about the possibly

5
00:00:10,153 --> 00:00:12,010
thrilling and possibly
nerve-wracking

6
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,560
process of giving a
conference talk in our field.

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,590
Let's start with the
basic structure of a talk.

8
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,130
This is pretty easy.

9
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,430
It's probably going to mirror
the structure of papers

10
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:22,330
in our field.

11
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,880
But the thing to keep in mind
is that the top narrative

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,760
has to be dramatically simpler.

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,130
The beginning should start
just like a paper does

14
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,780
and just like an abstract does.

15
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,090
You need to answer questions
that involve context.

16
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,100
What problem are you solving?

17
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,110
Why is the problem important?

18
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,750
What's been tried before and
why wasn't it a full solution?

19
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,030
These things will
contextualize your results

20
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,180
and set your audience up to be
prepared for the contribution

21
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,890
that you're about to offer.

22
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,420
That will happen in the middle.

23
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,220
You'll give concrete
details about what

24
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,710
data you used, and then
crucially what approach you

25
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,710
took, and what its details
are up to the level of detail

26
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,350
you can supply in
a talk like this.

27
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,150
And also information
about your metrics.

28
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,410
How do you evaluate success?

29
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,530
These concrete details are
what constitute your proposal,

30
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,265
and they're really crucial.

31
00:01:07,265 --> 00:01:08,890
And then in the final
part of the talk,

32
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,770
you'll offer results in the
form of tables, and graphs,

33
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:12,760
and so forth.

34
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,520
And you might review some
aspects of the analysis from

35
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,830
your paper-- what
worked and what didn't.

36
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,630
What work still needs to be
done, and things like that.

37
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,520
And then crucially
at the very end,

38
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,290
you should be sure to articulate
what you achieved in the work

39
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,670
and why it's significant.

40
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,520
The idea is to leave the
audience with information

41
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,450
that will compel them to take
the time and energy to read

42
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,610
your actual paper for the full
details on your contribution.

43
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,400
And then that way,
the talk will serve

44
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:44,390
as an effective advertisement
for the underlying project.

45
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,240
Now you can read lots of
advice on the internet

46
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,020
about how to give effective
talks in various contexts.

47
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,520
And I would encourage you to
seek it out, because some of it

48
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,440
might really align
with your style.

49
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,750
You should keep in mind
though that styles differ

50
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,110
and contexts differ.

51
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,800
And so this will be a process
of figuring out what advice

52
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,850
is really suitable for you.

53
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,940
The one thing that I
can say with confidence

54
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,880
is that Patrick Blackburn's
fundamental insight

55
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,810
will apply no matter what the
context and what the style.

56
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,640
Patrick Blackburn asks, where
do good talks come from?

57
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,820
And his answer is honesty.

58
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,630
He says, a good
talk should never

59
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,480
stray far from simple,
honest communication.

60
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,520
And if you abide
by that, and you're

61
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,830
introspective about
where you've achieved

62
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,510
open, honest
communication and where

63
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,850
you fell short in various
talks that you give,

64
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,890
and you're willing to
learn from that process,

65
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,140
you will definitely
find your style

66
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,060
and become an
effective communicator

67
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,520
about scientific
ideas, according

68
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,900
to what works best for you.

69
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,010


70
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,350
A note about PowerPoint.

71
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,910
You can find lots
of think pieces

72
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,120
about how PowerPoint and
related slide technologies are

73
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,160
inherently kind of evil.

74
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,310
I think they can be used
to confuse and deceive,

75
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,530
but they also have lots
of good aspects to them.

76
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,090
And it's not an
accident that slides

77
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,920
are pretty pervasive when
giving talks in our field.

78
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,220
And it's just a matter,
again, of finding your style

79
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,470
and thinking about how
to use these slides

80
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,820
for open, honest communication.

81
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,470
In that vein, and again, this
is a matter of personal style,

82
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,930
I thought I would mention two
kind of schools of thought

83
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,710
when it comes to slide design.

84
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,298
The minimalist and
the comparative.

85
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:18,840
So the minimalist
would probably just

86
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,450
have two words on the slide,
the minimalist and comparative.

87
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,090
And the rest would be
delivered via a talk track.

88
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,740
The idea behind the
minimalist approach

89
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,470
is a slide should be
as spare as possible.

90
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,470
The audience should spend most
of their time listening and--

91
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,480
listening to you
and looking at you.

92
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,240
And individual slides
don't stay up for very long

93
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,740
or get used in
more than one way.

94
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,740
They're kind of punctuation
for your narrative talk track.

95
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,170
By contrast, the
comparative approach

96
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,110
would be to have lots of
details on your slides.

97
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,060
Slides should be
as full as possible

98
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,070
without sacrificing clarity.

99
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,750
Your talk should make
it easy for people

100
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,390
to spend time
studying your slides.

101
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,890
You have to think about how
your narrative is going to align

102
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,750
with the very detailed slides.

103
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,540
And individual slides might
stay up for a long time

104
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,970
and get used to make
multiple comparisons

105
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,655
and establish
numerous connections.

106
00:04:06,655 --> 00:04:08,530
I want to emphasize
again that this is really

107
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,490
a personal matter.

108
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,490
The minimalist view seems
right for telling a story.

109
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,830
It's often the best when
time is of the essence,

110
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,570
and the audience is
mainly there to learn

111
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,565
about what your paper contains.

112
00:04:18,565 --> 00:04:20,815
Whereas the comparative view
seems right for teaching,

113
00:04:20,815 --> 00:04:21,459
right?

114
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:23,170
It's the closest
that the slides can

115
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,870
come to full, well-organized
chalkboards and things

116
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,760
like that, where a
lot of information

117
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,340
might stay up for
a very long time.

118
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,440
Fundamentally, though,
this is a matter of style.

119
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,010
Find the version that works for
you for the context you're in.

120
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,890
And I'll just say again, as
long as you think long and hard

121
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,860
about what it would be like
to listen to your talk, that

122
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,010
is that open communication part,
and you adjust accordingly,

123
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,510
I'm sure that you'll
shine no matter

124
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,930
what approach you choose.

125
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,000
I really like
slides when it comes

126
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,670
to using them to guide
audience attention and help

127
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,340
people follow the narrative
of your talk track.

128
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,440
One fundamental thing
that you can do for that

129
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,570
is make heavy use of overlays.

130
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,510
Overlays might allow you to
fill a slide with information

131
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,850
in that comparative
mode whilst still

132
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,520
keeping the audience with you
as you make individual points.

133
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,460
You can also use
color systematically

134
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,650
on the slide to create
distinctions and highlight

135
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,330
different pieces of information.

136
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,160
If you use it
consistently, then people

137
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,370
will figure out that you're
using color for one concept,

138
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,620
and that will really help
them key into the structure

139
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,670
of your ideas.

140
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,440
Take an accessible
color palette,

141
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,180
and then this can
really be your friend

142
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,770
when it comes to communicating
with an audience.

143
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:34,390
You can also use size to draw
attention to things, and boxes,

144
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,100
and arrows, and
other devices to help

145
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,400
people navigate, especially
complex information

146
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,880
displayed on your slides.

147
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,390
This is incredibly useful
when you are, for example,

148
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,540
displaying a figure of
results, to have boxes

149
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,125
as overlays on the individual
comparisons and results

150
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,250
that you want to highlight.

151
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,840
Same thing for a model diagram.

152
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,790
You could show the
whole model diagram

153
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,420
and then use boxes to highlight
different pieces of information

154
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,780
in the diagram as you talk about
them in your narrative talk

155
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,410
track.

156
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,120
And that can be
incredibly valuable

157
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,910
when it comes to helping people
navigate what would otherwise

158
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:11,180
be a very complicated
looking slide.

159
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,100
Of course, you could
offer the information

160
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,570
that I just delivered in
the more minimalist version.

161
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:19,970
This would be like overlays,
color, size, boxes, and arrows,

162
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,110
and so forth.

163
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,570
For particular styles,
that might be exactly

164
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,090
the right moment to talk about
guiding audience attention.

165
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,730
You can probably see that
it's not really my style,

166
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:32,570
but it's certainly a valid style
that can be very effective.

167
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,430
Some more mundane things.

168
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,920
Turn off any notifications that
might appear on your screen.

169
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,820
If you're on up in front of an
audience of hundreds of people

170
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,740
and we see a notification
about a friend's email,

171
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,740
well, it will certainly
be an entertaining thing

172
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,510
for your audience to
see, but it might not

173
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,610
be something that you wanted
to be part of your talk.

174
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,070
Make sure your computer
is out of power-save mode

175
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,180
so that the screen doesn't
shut off while you're talking.

176
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,650
Projectors can be finicky.

177
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,618
And even one time,
losing your screen

178
00:06:59,618 --> 00:07:01,160
could cause you to
lose the projector

179
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,660
and burn through a
bunch of the time

180
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,290
that you have allotted
for your talk.

181
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,380
And that could be really sad.

182
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,230
Shut down running applications
that might tax your computer

183
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,760
or otherwise get
in your way, again

184
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,630
with notifications
and things like that.

185
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,893
Make sure your desktop is
clear of files and notes

186
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,560
that you wouldn't
want the world to see.

187
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,935
In this day and
age, your desktop

188
00:07:18,935 --> 00:07:21,650
might flash for a second
before the slides come up.

189
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,410
And for all you
know, this talk is

190
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,670
going to end up on YouTube
for the whole world to see.

191
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:29,520
So think about the
privacy aspects of this.

192
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,160
If you're using PowerPoint,
or Keynote, or Google Slides,

193
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,980
or something like that,
create a PDF as a backup.

194
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,080
If your program fails
or the internet fails,

195
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,550
you might not have access
to your primary version.

196
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,680
Having a PDF backup will
certainly be helpful.

197
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,780
And be prepared
for the worst case.

198
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,640
What if the projector fails?

199
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,140
You might really
be glad that you're

200
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,110
prepared to give the
talk without any slides.

201
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,790
Imagine that scenario.

202
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,320
The audience will
be on your side

203
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,658
in the presence of such
a failure of technology,

204
00:07:57,658 --> 00:07:59,700
and it could be really a
chance for you to shine.

205
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,533
And the one thing I'll
say is that if you're

206
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:05,250
prepared, genuinely prepared to
give your talk without slides,

207
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,720
the resulting talk
will be better

208
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,798
because the narrative
part of your talk

209
00:08:08,798 --> 00:08:09,840
will be so much stronger.

210
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,600


211
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,490
Finally, the discussion
period, which

212
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,490
could be an exciting discussion
period or the most dreaded part

213
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,170
of this whole process.

214
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,440
It's an important part of
your presentation though.

215
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,570
It should be a chance
for the audience

216
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,150
to gain a deeper
understanding of your ideas.

217
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,010
And when the discussion
period actually has that aim,

218
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,920
it's really a joy
and it feels like you

219
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,340
and your audience are
moving forward together.

220
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,020
Sometimes other
things happen, though.

221
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,510
You could get a hostile
questioner, or a confused

222
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,270
questioner, or something
even more chaotic.

223
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,630
Be ready for this, and just
try to remain on an even keel

224
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,290
no matter what happens.

225
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,760
When you get questions,
after each one,

226
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,880
take a pause for a
second before answering.

227
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,140
This will serve two functions.

228
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,690
First, you'll make sure
that the person is actually

229
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,520
finished asking
their question, which

230
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,050
I think is socially useful.

231
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,797
And second, it will just make
you appear more deliberative,

232
00:09:02,797 --> 00:09:03,380
which is good.

233
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,930
So even if you know exactly
what answer you want to give,

234
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,180
taking the pause will
create a good impression

235
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,460
on your audience.

236
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,970
Avoid where possible saying,
I have no idea in response

237
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,140
to things, and
leaving it at that.

238
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,770
If you truly are floored, you
might, say I have no idea,

239
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,375
but let's think about the
following other considerations.

240
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,750
There might be cases where
you actually just want to say,

241
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,770
I have no idea and
leave it at that.

242
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,690
But I think that that should
be used very sparingly.

243
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,090
Most questions won't
make total sense to you.

244
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,340
You have to remember that
your questioner doesn't know

245
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,870
the work as well as you do.

246
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,240
They might have lost track
of some of the details

247
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,950
or gotten distracted
for a moment.

248
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,870
The question might not
completely make sense.

249
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,400
You'll feel victorious though
if you can work every question

250
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,455
you get into one that makes
sense and leaves everyone

251
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,080
with the impression
that the questioner

252
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,640
raised an important issue.

253
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,080
Again, that's
another way that you

254
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,810
can create a collective
feeling that the discussion was

255
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:57,860
productive.

256
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,950
And as a group, move the
ideas forward as part

257
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,570
of this discussion period.

258
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,250
That's when this
is really exciting.

259
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,940
And you should do everything you
can to strive for such moments

260
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,730
knowing, though, that
things could go really awry.

261
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:13,460
And don't try to internalize
those too much either.

262
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,683
This is a messy process.

263
00:10:14,683 --> 00:10:16,100
But fundamentally,
I think, it can

264
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,910
be quite rewarding in the end.

265
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:23,000
