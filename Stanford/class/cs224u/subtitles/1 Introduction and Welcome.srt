00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,960
Hi I'm Chris Potts I'm a professor in

2
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:08,800
linguistics at stanford with a courtesy

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,400
appointment in computer science and i'm

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,000
the director of stanford center for the

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,919
study of language and information which

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,919
is an interdisciplinary research center

7
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:17,759
focused on logic language decision

8
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,039
making human sentence processing and

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,400
my undergraduate and graduate degrees

10
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,399
are all in linguistics the work i did

11
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:28,000
linguistic pragmatics which is the study

12
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:29,759
of how language use is shaped by the

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,480
physical and social context that we're

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,359
at a certain point i went looking for

15
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,520
new ways to support those theories

16
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,799
quantitatively and that began my journey

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,960
into the world of natural language

18
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,399
processing i now think of myself as

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,239
being on a mission to help with the

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,879
sharing of ideas back and forth between

21
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,718
linguistics and nlp i've taught natural

22
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,359
language understanding nine times at

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,280
stanford with my first year in 2012. in

24
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:53,439
2012 we were just beginning to see how

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,679
nlu was going to revolutionize the field

26
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:58,159
and reshape the technology landscape

27
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,320
ibm's watson had recently won jeopardy

28
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,759
apple siri was new and the other tech

29
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,600
giants were on the verge of launching

30
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,280
their own intelligent assistance so

31
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,280
there was a widespread perception that

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,519
nlu was poised to have a transformative

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,000
impact on the world and that perception

34
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,759
was certainly correct since then nlu has

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,438
only become more central to the field of

36
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,359
intelligence more generally and the

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,359
progress in the field has been amazing

38
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,519
we have more large NLU data sets than

39
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,519
ever before and the level of innovation

40
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,879
in modeling and model analysis is just astounding.

41
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,399
as a result we can tackle more ambitious

42
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,159
problems than ever and there are

43
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,478
opportunities to find lots of creative

44
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,600
new ways to apply nlu to technology

45
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:39,359
development and scientific inquiry

46
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,879
so it's certainly an exciting moment to

47
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,560
welcome you to this course it's an

48
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,719
adapted version of the course we teach

49
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,640
on campus the course begins by covering

50
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,798
a wide range of models for distributed

51
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,560
word representations from there we

52
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,200
branch out into a series of important

53
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,960
nlu topics including relation extraction

54
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,960
natural language inference and grounded

55
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,478
language understanding we've chosen

56
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,158
these topics because they allow us to

57
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,239
highlight many of the central concepts

58
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,840
in nlu which you can then apply more

59
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,280
one of the special aspects of this

60
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,038
course is that it's project oriented and

61
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,360
with luck the project that you develop

62
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,279
will become a professional asset for you

63
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,280
we aim to help you design and conduct a

64
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,640
successful research project in the field

65
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,959
and we have an accomplished teaching

66
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,399
team to help you with this process

67
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,000
even the regular assignments are

68
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,080
oriented toward building original

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,159
projects each assignment is grounded in

70
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,920
a specific topic area and they all have

71
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,079
a common rhythm in that they ask you to

72
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,759
build up some baseline systems and then

73
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,319
develop your own original system for

74
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:37,679
you'll enter each one of these systems

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,360
into what we call a bake off which is an

76
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,879
informal competition around data and

77
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,560
modeling and the teaching team will

78
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,719
reflect the insights we gain from these

79
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,560
bake off entries back to the whole class

80
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,800
it's also common for bake off entries to

81
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,159
grow into final projects we hope that

82
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,080
all this work spurs you to think

83
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,799
creatively and to hone your practical

84
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,760
and theoretical skills in nlu so without
