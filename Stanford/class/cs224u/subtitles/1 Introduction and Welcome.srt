00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,400
Hi, I'm Chris Potts. I'm a professor in

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,530
linguistics at Stanford with a courtesy appointment in

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,450
computer science and I'm the director of

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,910
Stanford Center for the Study of Language and Information,

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,060
which is an interdisciplinary research center focused on logic,

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,915
language, decision-making, human sentence processing, and computation.

7
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:22,005
My undergraduate and graduate degrees are all in linguistics.

8
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:25,650
The work I did for my PhD focused on topics in linguistic pragmatics,

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,990
which is the study of how language use is shaped by

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,790
the physical and social contexts that we're in.

11
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,440
At a certain point I went looking for new ways to support those theories

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,760
quantitatively, and that began my journey into the world of natural language processing.

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,400
I now think of myself as being on a mission to help with

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,000
the sharing of ideas back and forth between linguistics and NLP.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,340
I've taught natural-language understanding nine

16
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,100
times at Stanford with my first year in 2012.

17
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,190
In 2012, we were just beginning to see how NLU was gonna

18
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,700
revolutionize the field and reshape the technology landscape.

19
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,175
IBM's Watson had recently won Jeopardy,

20
00:00:58,175 --> 00:00:59,705
Apple's Siri was new,

21
00:00:59,705 --> 00:01:01,520
and the other tech giants were on the verge of

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,590
launching their own intelligent assistants.

23
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,650
So there was a widespread perception that NLU was poised to have

24
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,835
a transformative impact on the world and that perception was certainly correct.

25
00:01:10,835 --> 00:01:15,080
Since then, NLU has only become more central to the field of NLP and to all of

26
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,415
artificial intelligence more generally, and the progress in the field has been amazing.

27
00:01:19,415 --> 00:01:22,680
We have more large NLU datasets than ever before and

28
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,705
the level of innovation in modeling and model analysis is just astounding.

29
00:01:26,705 --> 00:01:28,250
As a result, we can tackle

30
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,550
more ambitious problems than ever and there are opportunities to find

31
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:37,210
lots of creative new ways to apply NLU to technology development and scientific inquiry.

32
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,670
So it's certainly an exciting moment to welcome you to this course.

33
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,490
It's an adapted version of the course we teach on campus.

34
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,740
The course begins by covering a wide range of

35
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,110
models for distributed word representations.

36
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,560
From there, we branch out into a series of important NLU topics,

37
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,575
including relation extraction, natural language inference,

38
00:01:54,575 --> 00:01:56,360
and grounded language understanding.

39
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,450
We've chosen these topics because they allow us to highlight many of

40
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,425
the central concepts in NLU which you can then apply more widely.

41
00:02:03,425 --> 00:02:08,000
One of the special aspects of this course is that it's project-oriented and with luck,

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,360
the project that you develop will become a professional asset for you.

43
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,870
We aim to help you design and conduct a successful research project in

44
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,820
the field and we have an accomplished teaching team to help you with this process.

45
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,820
Even the regular assignments are oriented toward building original projects.

46
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,260
Each assignment is grounded in

47
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,920
a specific topic area and they all have a common rhythm in that they ask you

48
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,260
to build up some baseline systems and then

49
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,875
develop your own original system for solving the task at hand.

50
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:37,430
You'll enter each one of these systems into what we call a bake-off,

51
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,100
which is an informal competition around data and modeling,

52
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,300
and the teaching team will reflect the insights we gain

53
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,825
from these bake-off entries back to the whole class.

54
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:48,260
It's also common for bake-off entries to grow into final projects.

55
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,019
We hope that all this spurs you to think creatively

56
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:54,170
and to hone your practical and theoretical skills in NLU.

57
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,390
So without further ado, let's get started.
