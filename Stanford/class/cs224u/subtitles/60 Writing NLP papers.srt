CHRISTOPHER POTTS:
Hello, everyone.

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,950
Welcome to part 2 in our series
on presenting your research.

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,930
We're going to be talking about
writing papers in our fields.

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,710
To start, let's look at the
outline of a typical NLP paper.

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,680
By and large, these are either
four or eight page papers

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,650
in a two-column format that
you get from the style sheets.

8
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,350
Those links don't
include the references.

9
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,850
And there are a
bunch of conventions

10
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,750
for how the papers are
typically organized.

11
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,033
So you have your title
in abstract on page one.

12
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:31,450
Usually, you have
an intro section

13
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,783
that kind of fits on that
first page, maybe a little bit

14
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,260
onto the second.

15
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,960
In place two, you
discuss the related work

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,730
or prior literature
or background

17
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,590
that's needed to
kind of contextualize

18
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,320
the work that you're doing.

19
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,820
Then there's typically
a data section, followed

20
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,620
by a section on a
model or this could

21
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,510
be thought of as the
kind of core proposal

22
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,250
section of the paper.

23
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,610
Then there'll be some methods
related to the experiments.

24
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,370
The reporting of the
results of the experiments.

25
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:00,970
And then some analysis of what
the experimental results mean.

26
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,900
And then possibly
a short conclusion.

27
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,670
It's not set in
stone that you have

28
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,100
to follow these conventions,
but if you do follow them,

29
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,260
I think it will be
easier on your readers

30
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,030
and also easier
on you as a writer

31
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,980
because you can kind
of slot your ideas

32
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,330
into this familiar format.

33
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,330
Let's look at those sections
in a little bit of detail.

34
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,560
So starting with the intro,
the ideal intro, to my mind,

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,320
really tells the full story
of your paper at a high level.

36
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,890
We don't need all the details,
but it is very helpful

37
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,610
to know from beginning to end
what the paper accomplishes.

38
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,070
And good intros provide
all of that information

39
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,290
and really tell the reader
precisely what they'll

40
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,570
learn as they go through
the rest of the paper.

41
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,940
In place two as I
said, is the discussion

42
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,920
of background material
or related work

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,180
or prior literature.

44
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,930
And this is an opportunity for
you to contextualize your work,

45
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,750
and provide insights
into the major themes

46
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,373
of the literature as a whole.

47
00:01:55,373 --> 00:01:57,290
What you should really
be thinking about doing

48
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,300
is using each
paper or each theme

49
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,900
that you identify as a chance
to kind of contextualize

50
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,450
your ideas, and
especially articulate

51
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,490
what's special about
the contribution

52
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:08,850
that you're making.

53
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,230
So this kind of sets the
stage for the reader.

54
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,450
The data section,
this could vary a lot.

55
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,780
This could be very detailed if
you're offering a new dataset,

56
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,080
or using a dataset in some
unfamiliar way the community is

57
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,140
not used to.

58
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,140
But of course, if you're
just adopting some data

59
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:28,800
off the shelf, then this
section might be pretty short.

60
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,770
Then you get to the heart of
your proposal, your model.

61
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,690
You want to flesh
out your own approach

62
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,400
and really help us understand
your core contribution.

63
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,890
Then we turn to
supporting your ideas

64
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,840
with some experimental evidence.

65
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,790
You report the methods,
your experimental approach,

66
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,400
including descriptions
of the metrics.

67
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,942
And again, that will
be long or short

68
00:02:47,942 --> 00:02:50,930
depending on whether the metrics
are familiar or unfamiliar.

69
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,810
You want to describe your
baseline models and anything

70
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,540
else that's relevant to kind
of understanding precisely

71
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,540
what's going to happen
in your experiments.

72
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,270
I will say that for details
about hyperparameters

73
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,610
and optimization choices and
so forth, you can probably

74
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,950
move those to an
appendix, unless they're

75
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,300
really central to the argument.

76
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,960
What you want to offer here are
kind of the crucial pieces that

77
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,300
will help the reader
understand precisely what you

78
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,200
did for your experiments.

79
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,280
Then we get our results.

80
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,710
This could be a no-nonsense
report of what happened.

81
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,570
It's probably mainly
going to be supported

82
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,610
by figures and tables that
report a summary of your core

83
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:29,770
findings according to your
data models and metrics.

84
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,060
And then things open up a bit.

85
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,395
You have an analysis section.

86
00:03:32,395 --> 00:03:33,770
I think this is
really important.

87
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:37,180
You should articulate for the
reader what your results mean,

88
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,070
what they don't
mean, where they can

89
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,680
be improved, where their limits
are, and so forth, right?

90
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,410
These sections vary a lot
depending on the nature

91
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,030
of the paper and the findings.

92
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,620
But I think they're
always important

93
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,620
and they can be very rewarding.

94
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,990
It is intimidating because
this is awfully open ended.

95
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,780
But I'm hoping that the previous
unit on analysis methods

96
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,320
in our field offer some really
good general purpose tools

97
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,110
and techniques for doing
rich analyses of this sort

98
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,960
and really helping us
understand precisely what you

99
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,070
accomplished.

100
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:10,217
Now this is, as I said,
is not set in stone,

101
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:12,800
and different projects will call
for different variants on it.

102
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,720
And one really prominent
variant that you see

103
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,970
is that, if you have
multiple experiments

104
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,190
with multiple datasets
you might want

105
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,300
to repeat that method's results
analysis rhythm across all

106
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,860
of your experiments
to give them kind

107
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,380
of separate sections
in your paper.

108
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,000
But again, it really
depends on what

109
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,180
you think the most natural
way to express your ideas is.

110
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,600
These things aren't
set in stone,

111
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,510
they're just
conventions that help us

112
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,280
as readers and as authors.

113
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,780
Then finally, you
have a conclusion.

114
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,810
This is probably a quick
summary of what the paper did,

115
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,210
and then an opportunity
for you to chart out

116
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,970
future directions that you
or others might pursue.

117
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:53,590
So it's a chance to be more
outward looking and expansive.

118
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,260
Let me close the screen cast
with some general advice

119
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,700
on scientific
writing that I think

120
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,500
can be helpful kind
of in the background

121
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,380
as you think about
expressing your ideas.

122
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,320
First, I just want to review
this really nice piece

123
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,360
from Stuart Shieber,
where he advocates

124
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,610
for what he calls the
"rational reconstruction"

125
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,500
approach to scientific writing.

126
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,890
And to build up to that, he
offers two contrasting styles

127
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,460
that you might think about.

128
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,030
The first is what he calls
the continental style.

129
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,790
This is in which one
states the solution with as

130
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,280
little introduction or
motivation as possible,

131
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,630
sometimes not even saying
what the problem was.

132
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,430
He says, "Readers will have
no clue as to whether you're

133
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,500
right or not without
incredible efforts

134
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,180
in close reading of the paper.

135
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,240
But at least, they'll
think you're a genius."

136
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,830
At the other end
of the extreme, you

137
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,750
have what he calls
the historical style.

138
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,170
And this is a whole history of
false starts, wrong attempts,

139
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:48,200
near misses, redefinitions
of the problem.

140
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,850
This is a kind of
genuine history

141
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,400
of maybe the struggles
that you endured

142
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,640
as you built up to the final
product for your paper.

143
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,747
And Shieber says,
"This is much better

144
00:05:57,747 --> 00:06:00,080
than the continental style,
because a careful reader can

145
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,910
probably follow the
line of reasoning

146
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,330
that the author went through
and use this as motivation.

147
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,800
But the reader
will probably think

148
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,300
you're a bit addle-headed."

149
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,490
We don't need to hear
about every dead end

150
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,520
and every false start,
what we would like, rather,

151
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,790
is what Shieber calls the
rational reconstruction.

152
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,640
You don't present the actual
history that you went through,

153
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,700
but rather, an idealized
history that perfectly motivates

154
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,930
each step in the solution.

155
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,420
You might selectively
choose models

156
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,150
that you abandoned as a way
of helping the other reader

157
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,230
understand how you built toward
your actual core set of methods

158
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,250
and findings and results.

159
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,850
So it's going to be a kind
of streamlined version

160
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,130
of that historical style.

161
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:43,102
The goal in pursuing the
rational reconstruction style

162
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:44,810
is not to convince
the reader that you're

163
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,150
brilliant, or addle-headed
for that matter,

164
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,760
but that your
solution is trivial.

165
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,070
Shieber says it takes a
certain strength of character

166
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,630
to take that as one's goal.

167
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,020
Right, the goal of writing
a really excellent paper

168
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,000
is that the reader
comes away thinking,

169
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,180
that was clear and obvious,
and even I could have done it.

170
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,030
That's an act of
genuine communication.

171
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,100
And it does take a
strength of character.

172
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,560
But in the end, this is what
we should all be striving for,

173
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,460
this kind of really clear
and open communication.

174
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,480
This is also a nice
document from David Goss.

175
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,670
He has some hints on
mathematical style.

176
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,200
There's a bunch of
low level details

177
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,752
in there, especially related
to presenting very formal work.

178
00:07:23,752 --> 00:07:25,210
The piece that I
wanted to pull out

179
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,310
is just "Have mercy
on the reader."

180
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,770
This is, again, recalling
the rational reconstruction

181
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,530
approach that Shieber advocated
for, where you're really

182
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,380
thinking about what it's like
to be a reader encountering

183
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,110
the ideas for the first
time and genuinely

184
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,342
trying to understand
what you accomplished.

185
00:07:40,342 --> 00:07:41,800
You have to really
think about what

186
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,080
it's like to be in
that position in order

187
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,260
to have a successful
and clear paper.

188
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,290
I also really like this piece
from the novelist Cormac

189
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,190
McCarthy which was
published in Nature.

190
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,890
It's full of great advice.

191
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:57,998
The one piece that I wanted
to highlight is this.

192
00:07:57,998 --> 00:07:59,540
Quote-unquote,
McCarthy says, "Decide

193
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,670
on your paper's theme
and two or three

194
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,400
points you want every
reader to remember.

195
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,280
This theme and these points
from the central thread

196
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,780
that runs through your piece.

197
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,710
The words, sentences,
paragraphs,

198
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,808
and sections are the needlework
that holds it together.

199
00:08:13,808 --> 00:08:16,100
If something isn't needed to
help the reader understand

200
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,210
the main theme, omit it."

201
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,820
This is helpful to
me because I think

202
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,890
it not only results
in a better paper,

203
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,640
but it will also be easier
for you to write your paper.

204
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,770
Because the themes you
choose will determine

205
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,980
what to include and exclude,
and resolve a lot of low level

206
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,080
questions about your narrative.

207
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,870
And conversely, I've often found
that when I'm really struggling

208
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,990
to write a paper, it's because
I haven't figured out what

209
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,480
these core themes are and
I'm kind of casting about,

210
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,520
unsure of what's relevant
and what's irrelevant.

211
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,790
And if you step back
and really figure out

212
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,390
what you're trying
to communicate,

213
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:52,957
then the act of writing kind
of all falls into place.

214
00:08:52,957 --> 00:08:55,290
And then the final bit of
advice that I wanted to offer,

215
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,035
which I'm going to return to
when we talk about presenting

216
00:08:58,035 --> 00:09:00,113
work at conferences.

217
00:09:00,113 --> 00:09:01,530
This comes from
Patrick Blackburn.

218
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,300
It's about talks,
but it really extends

219
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,060
to any kind of
communication and science,

220
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,590
is fundamental insight, he asks.

221
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,680
"Where do good talks,
and I think good papers,

222
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,740
where do they come from?"

223
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,230
And he says, "Honesty."

224
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,470
A good talk or a good
paper should never

225
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,680
stray far from simple,
honest communication.

226
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,990
And you can hear this
in the way that we talk

227
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,310
about evaluating your work.

228
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,710
That fundamentally
for us, we're looking

229
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:29,970
for papers that offer open,
clear, honest communication

230
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,530
about what happened,
and what it means.

231
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,420
And that's really a
fundamental value.

232
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,180
And I think it's
inspiring to think

233
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,460
about this as your
kind of guiding light

234
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:42,650
when you report your scientific
results to the community.

235
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:47,000
