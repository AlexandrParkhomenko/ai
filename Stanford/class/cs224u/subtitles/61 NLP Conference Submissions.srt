00:00:04,628 --> 00:00:05,920
CHRIS POTTS: Welcome, everyone.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,430
This is part three in our series
on presenting your research.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,080
We're going to be talking
about the sometimes

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,670
thrilling and
sometimes agonizing

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,030
process of submitting your
work for publication at an NLP

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,685
conference.

8
00:00:16,685 --> 00:00:18,060
To start, I want
to review what's

9
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,080
known as the anonymity
period for ACL conferences.

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,470
All of the ACL conferences that
have adopted a uniform policy

11
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,860
that submitted papers cannot be
uploaded to repositories like

12
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,159
arXiv or made public in other
ways starting one month from

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,620
the submission deadline and
extending through the time when

14
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,360
decisions go out.

15
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,570
So you should be aware of this,
and for specific conferences,

16
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,910
check their sites
for the precise date

17
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,690
when the embargo
goes into effect

18
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,380
so that you're sure you're
playing by the rules.

19
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,270
The rationale of the
policy is an attempt

20
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,120
to balance the benefits of
free and fast distribution

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,370
of new ideas against the
benefits of double blind peer

22
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:54,870
review.

23
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,590
The idea is that we want to
avoid corrupting reviewers just

24
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,570
at the moment that
they sit down to begin

25
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,450
their work of reviewing
by having them see

26
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,380
on arXiv or via Twitter an
announcement about the paper

27
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,880
they're reviewing that reveals
the authors, and the origins,

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,910
and so forth, because we know
that that public announcement

29
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,220
would influence their
decision-making process.

30
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,500
So to preserve that balance
against free dissemination

31
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,200
of ideas, we have
this embargo period

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,210
around the period where we
know reviewing will happen.

33
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,040
For more on the policy
and its rationale,

34
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,482
you can follow this link here.

35
00:01:29,482 --> 00:01:31,190
But I would say that,
fundamentally, it's

36
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,380
an attempt to balance
these two pressures,

37
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,760
the kind of pragmatic
approach to balancing them.

38
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,940
OK, now let's dive into the
actual process of submitting

39
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,430
work for publication and having
it go through review at one

40
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,430
of these conferences.

41
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,940
So to start, let's suppose
you've submitted your paper.

42
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,180
When you do that, you'll
select some area keywords

43
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,820
that will help determine which
committee gets your paper.

44
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,880
This is already a
really important step.

45
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,400
You'll be choosing from
a bunch of keywords that

46
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,392
signal different areas of NLP.

47
00:01:59,392 --> 00:02:00,850
And what you're
doing at that point

48
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,280
is probably routing your
paper to certain sets

49
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,910
of reviewers and certain
area chairs and so forth.

50
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,620
And in doing that,
you're creating

51
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,990
expectations about the
kind of contribution

52
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,260
that you're making.

53
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,230
So if you're unsure
about this process,

54
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,840
I would encourage you to
recruit an expert in the NLP

55
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,350
reviewing process to help you
make these keyword selections.

56
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,790
Here's an example of how
this could be important.

57
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,670
Suppose that your
paper is fundamentally

58
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,800
a new machine
learning contribution

59
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,570
but it reports some
experiments that

60
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,870
involve kind of topics in
computational social science,

61
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,880
it might be really
a mistake to choose

62
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,630
the computational social
science keyword at this point,

63
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,530
because if your paper
ends up with reviewers who

64
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,210
have expectations
that you'll be making

65
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,330
some new and fundamental
contribution to that area

66
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,570
and what they're looking at is
a machine learning contribution,

67
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,060
that mismatch in
their expectations

68
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,980
might lead them to have
a negative perception

69
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,970
of the work.

70
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,890
And the reverse of
course, holds as well.

71
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,340
If you have a fundamentally new
computational social sciences

72
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,650
contribution but it
incidentally makes

73
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,420
use of some machine
learning apparatus,

74
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,970
I think it would be a mistake
to choose machine learning

75
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,730
as a keyword, precisely
because of that mismatch

76
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,700
in expectations that would
result in reviewers' minds

77
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,410
when they sat down and
started reviewing your paper.

78
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:18,040
So think strategically
about this stage.

79
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,770
You can see why it's important
at this next stage here.

80
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,200
Reviewers when they
begin their work,

81
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,450
they're going to first
scan a long list of titles

82
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,023
and abstracts, and they'll
make bids on which ones

83
00:03:28,023 --> 00:03:28,690
they want to do.

84
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,270
At this point they signal
yes or maybe or no,

85
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,550
or maybe they indicate
a conflict of interest,

86
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,250
indicating that they can't
review the paper at all.

87
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,580
When they do this, the title
is probably the primary factor

88
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,020
in bidding decisions.

89
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,822
They probably have access to
the abstract at this stage,

90
00:03:43,822 --> 00:03:45,280
but they might be
looking at a list

91
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,835
of over 200 different
contributions,

92
00:03:47,835 --> 00:03:49,460
and it's probably
just too much to ask,

93
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,070
that they would read all of
these abstracts at this stage.

94
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,040
So they're probably
scanning the title

95
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,890
and using that as an indication
about what kind of bids

96
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:57,710
they want to make.

97
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,710
So again, you might
think strategically

98
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,690
about your title
and the role it will

99
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,890
play at this early
stage in the process.

100
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:09,250
After that, the program chairs
assign reviewers their papers

101
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,290
partly based on the
bidding or maybe

102
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,730
partly based on other
considerations of workloads

103
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,720
and so forth.

104
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,320
We don't know precisely how
that process will happen,

105
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,010
but by some mechanism your
paper will be assigned probably

106
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,950
three different reviewers.

107
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,040
Reviewers read the papers, write
comments and supply ratings

108
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,350
over the course of a few months.

109
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,020
At the very end of that
process, authors are typically

110
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,260
allowed to respond
briefly to the reviews,

111
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,720
and then the program
chair or the area chair

112
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,550
might seek to stimulate
some discussion

113
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,670
among the reviewers about
conflicts between their reviews

114
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,890
or maybe places where
the author responds,

115
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,420
and says the reviewers
are incorrect

116
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,070
or misguided or something.

117
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,760
We hope that that's a lively and
rich discussion about the paper

118
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,680
that's led by open-minded
people who are just

119
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,170
trying to arrive at the
best possible recommendation

120
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,460
for your paper.

121
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,330
That's what we hope at
this stage in the process.

122
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,670
And finally, at the very
end, the program committee

123
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,910
is going to do some magic to
arrive at the final program

124
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,720
based on all of this input.

125
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,950
Of course, their reviews and
ratings will be a major factor,

126
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,602
but there might be
other considerations

127
00:05:13,602 --> 00:05:15,310
that they bring in at
this stage in terms

128
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,160
of constructing a diverse
and interesting program

129
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,870
for their conference.

130
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,030
At this stage, you
might get a meta review

131
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,760
that provides some insight
into the final decision making

132
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,130
process, although those
vary in the amount

133
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,340
that they actually illuminate
the behind-the-scenes process

134
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,380
that led to the particular
recommendation that

135
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,780
was made by the
reviewers and area chair.

136
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,400


137
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,340
In terms of the work that the
actual reviewers are doing,

138
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,500
I would say that the
current ACL set up

139
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,130
is oriented around structured
text for the reviews as opposed

140
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:50,120
to providing a lot of
metadata via ratings.

141
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,940
So first, they'll probably
be asked to just indicate

142
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,940
what the paper is about,
what contributions it makes,

143
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,180
and what its main strengths
and weaknesses are.

144
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,930
This is a kind of check
that they actually

145
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,660
understand what's in the paper
and can articulate what's

146
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,090
in the paper, and it
gives the first indication

147
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,040
of their assessment.

148
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,100
Next you have reasons to
accept and reasons to reject.

149
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,440
Then there could be a section
for additional questions

150
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,780
and feedback for the authors.

151
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,080
Maybe the reviewers can indicate
missing references and maybe

152
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,240
also a catchall
section for typos,

153
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,000
grammar, style, and presentation
improvements and so forth.

154
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,420
But of course, you get two
really important ratings--

155
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,720
the overall recommendation
and maybe an assessment

156
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,270
of the reviewer's confidence
in their overall evaluation.

157
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,020
And then finally, there
could be a section

158
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,300
for confidential information
that the reviewers want

159
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,615
to communicate directly
to the program committee.

160
00:06:41,615 --> 00:06:43,490
That would be hidden
from the authors as well

161
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,450
as the other reviewers.

162
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,960
So stepping back, the
most important pieces

163
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,270
of this reviewing
form are obviously

164
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,550
the overall recommendation
must be balanced

165
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,850
against reviewer confidence
and the reasons to accept

166
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:56,870
and reasons to reject.

167
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,660
You can count on the two texts
that they supply under 2 and 3

168
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,760
here as being really important
to shaping the discussion that

169
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,220
happens and the overall
recommendation that gets made.

170
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,270


171
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,950
There's an author
response period

172
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,510
for at least the
major ACL conferences.

173
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,180
This is a chance for
authors to submit

174
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,940
short responses to the reviews.

175
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,370
This is a rather uncertain
business along many dimensions,

176
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,970
so let me just
offer some thoughts.

177
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:28,000
First, many people are
cynical about author responses

178
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,670
since they've observed
that reviewers rarely

179
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,680
change their scores
afterwards, and I

180
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,220
think that is an
important consideration.

181
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,110
However, it might just
be bad signaling not

182
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,590
to submit a response at all.

183
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,180
It could incidentally indicate
to the program committee

184
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,190
that you've kind of silently
opted out of the process,

185
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,520
so its mere absence
could reduce your chances

186
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,050
of getting accepted I believe.

187
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,440
More positively, for conferences
that have area chairs,

188
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,310
and I believe all of the current
major ACL conferences do,

189
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,350
the author response could
be really important.

190
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,360
An area chair is
someone who's tasked

191
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,580
with stimulating
discussion and writing

192
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,210
meta reviews for a small number
of papers-- maybe 5 to 20

193
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,460
depending on the
conference volume.

194
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,920
And for those people,
the author response

195
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,810
might have a major impact.

196
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,090
I played the role of
area chair many times,

197
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,760
and the author responses
are always valuable to me.

198
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,190
It's another text
alongside the reviews

199
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,530
that the reviewers
provided, and it

200
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:28,010
helps me understand places
of conflict, places where

201
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:31,340
the authors differ in their
perspective from the reviewers

202
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:31,970
and so forth.

203
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,030
It is always extremely
valuable evidence to me,

204
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,400
and I think that holds
for many area chairs.

205
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,530
And for this reason
alone, you might

206
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,390
think about submitting
a detailed author

207
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,000
response with these
area chairs in mind

208
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,420
as your primary readers.

209
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,460
NLP conferences,
for better or worse,

210
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,890
have very complex rules
about what you can and can't

211
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,570
say in these author responses.

212
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,780
Sometimes you can't
report any new results.

213
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,180
Sometimes you have to be very
circumspect about what kind

214
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,190
of results you
have and so forth.

215
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,690
If you have questions
about what you

216
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,820
can do in a particular
case, seek out

217
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,280
an expert at Stanford
for advice on how

218
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,220
to interpret the precise
rules and what kind of leeway

219
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,495
you actually have in saying what
you think is important to say.

220
00:09:13,495 --> 00:09:14,870
I think all of
these restrictions

221
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,130
are kind of unfortunate.

222
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,690
When I play the
role of area chair

223
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,390
and as reviewer, I would
simply like to have access

224
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,700
to all the information
that I can possibly obtain,

225
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,930
and so I would like these
author responses to be offering

226
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,370
as much information as
they feel is important,

227
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,730
and then I can use that to
balance all the evidence

228
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,920
to make a final recommendation.

229
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,690
So it's unfortunate
from my perspective

230
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:38,330
that these have restrictions at
all, but they're often there,

231
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:42,370
and it's important to figure
out how to navigate them.

232
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:46,577
When you construct an author
response, always be polite.

233
00:09:46,577 --> 00:09:48,160
You can be firm and
direct, but you'll

234
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,260
want to do that
strategically to signal

235
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,020
what you feel most strongly
about, but fundamentally,

236
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,420
you should never say
things like this--

237
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,340
"Your inattentiveness
is embarrassing.

238
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,070
Section 6 does what
you say we didn't do."

239
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,500
You might privately say
that to your co-authors

240
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,810
as a kind of cathartic
act of venting

241
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,930
about how bad your reviews
were, but you should never

242
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,790
put it in an author response.

243
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,730
Rather, you should do things
that are more like, "Thank you.

244
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,290
The information you're
requesting is in section 6.

245
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,998
We will make this more
prominent in our revision."

246
00:10:17,998 --> 00:10:19,540
Fundamentally here,
I think it's just

247
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,210
important to be polite in
these professional contexts,

248
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,130
and it's a way to
remind yourself

249
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:27,850
that these reviewers did make
an investment of their own time

250
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,950
and intellectual
energy into your work,

251
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:32,955
and we want to be respectful
and aware of that investment

252
00:10:32,955 --> 00:10:33,580
that they made.

253
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,030


254
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,710
Presentation types and venues.

255
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,710
There are lots of them.

256
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,627
So first, there's the
fundamental distinction.

257
00:10:41,627 --> 00:10:43,900
You might have either oral
presentations or poster

258
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,270
presentations and
crosscutting that, you

259
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,550
might think about
submitting to a workshop

260
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,352
or to a main conference.

261
00:10:50,352 --> 00:10:52,810
And here's a whole bunch of
venues, and what I've done here

262
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,520
is kind of organized
this in a soft way.

263
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,260
So on the left here, I have
NLP conferences and workshops.

264
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,530
I've put what we consider
the most prestigious three

265
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,340
at the top here--

266
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,300
ACL, NAACL, and EMNLP, and
then some other large ones

267
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,590
just below that.

268
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,600
Of course, the prestige
order could really

269
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,760
change here, so who knows what
the next year's will bring.

270
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,792
For example, the Asia
ACL is brand new,

271
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:18,250
and of course, the
number of people

272
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,340
doing outstanding work in
our area throughout Asia

273
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,440
is enormous, and so
it's very easy for me

274
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,627
to imagine that AACL becomes
at least as prominent,

275
00:11:26,627 --> 00:11:28,960
maybe even more prominent,
than some of these other ones

276
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,180
up here over the next few years.

277
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,510
Then we have some smaller and
older conferences down here,

278
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,150
and then of course, at the
bottom, I've put workshops.

279
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:40,330
All of these major conferences
have workshop series attached

280
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:44,260
to them, and workshops can be
a great initial outlet for work

281
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,767
you do, especially for
a course like this.

282
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:48,850
So I would encourage you
for the major conferences

283
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,200
to scan their
program of workshops,

284
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,900
and if you find one
that's topically

285
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,400
aligned with what
you're working on,

286
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,680
consider submitting
to the workshop.

287
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,720
It will probably be
less competitive,

288
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,470
so you have better
chances of getting in,

289
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,260
but I would say the
more important thing

290
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,720
is that it's a chance for
you to actually connect

291
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,510
with a community of people
who are working on precisely

292
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,100
the topic that
you're working on,

293
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,850
and that can be intellectually
really exciting.

294
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,520
In the middle here, I have
some conferences that kind of

295
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:20,170
run the spectrum from
linguistics through the world

296
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:23,740
wide web, through knowledge
graphs and kind of more core

297
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,800
topics in the artificial
intelligence generally,

298
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,810
and those can be really
good outlets for work

299
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,617
that has an NLP aspect to it.

300
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,200
And then over here
on the right, these

301
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,810
are very prestigious machine
learning conferences,

302
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,340
and it's kind of the same story.

303
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,140
All of these
conferences here are

304
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,678
welcoming a work that involves
natural language processing,

305
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,720
but you might just have
to think about how you're

306
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,960
going to precisely connect
with these specific audiences

307
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,220
and their specific concerns.

308
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,220


309
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,740
Here's my personal assessment
of NLP reviewing at present.

310
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,440
First, I think the focus
on conference papers

311
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,100
as opposed to journals has
been really good for NLP.

312
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,700
It fits with and encourages the
very rapid pace of our field,

313
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:11,170
and I think we all benefit
from that rapid pace overall.

314
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,570
Before about 2010, the
reviewing in the field

315
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:16,030
was admirably good and
rigorous in comparison

316
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:16,780
with other fields.

317
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:20,230
It really was impressive
how many deep and insightful

318
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,240
reviews you would get
when you submitted

319
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,320
to one of the main
conferences in the field.

320
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,860
Lately though, the explosive
growth of the field

321
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,490
has, I think by consensus,
reduced the general quality

322
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:35,453
of reviewing, and the field
is still grappling with this.

323
00:13:35,453 --> 00:13:36,870
Of course, there
was always a kind

324
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:39,408
of lottery aspect to whether
your paper would be accepted,

325
00:13:39,408 --> 00:13:40,950
and you should keep
in mind that luck

326
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:45,330
is a real element in publication
and throughout science.

327
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,820
But that lottery aspect
has gotten more amplified

328
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,010
as the field has
grown, and that's

329
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,690
affecting the main
conferences in ways

330
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,400
that we all have to figure out.

331
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,350
But again, this
is kind of useful.

332
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:58,230
Keep in mind that a rejection
does not necessarily

333
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,410
mean that your work
was of low quality.

334
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,670
It could mean that you
just had really bad luck

335
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:06,950
throughout a kind of
chaotic reviewing process.

336
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,450
I also want to say
that I think it's

337
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:12,008
unhealthy to force every paper
to be four or eight pages.

338
00:14:12,008 --> 00:14:13,550
The reason that
happens is that there

339
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:16,190
are two kinds of submissions
typically-- a short paper which

340
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,550
has max length four, and a
long paper which has max length

341
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,920
eight, and we all,
as submitters to one

342
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,820
or another of those
tracks, feel a kind

343
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,390
of signaling pressure to
maximize the available space.

344
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,410
So there are no six page
papers in the field,

345
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,900
and there is really no
room to have papers that

346
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,460
are longer than eight pages.

347
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,500
And that's unfortunate,
because sometimes you

348
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,020
just need a different
length than one of these

349
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,178
to express your ideas in
the best possible way.

350
00:14:42,178 --> 00:14:43,220
So that's been unhealthy.

351
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,740
I will say, though, that
this is alleviated somewhat

352
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,040
by the increased use of
appendices and supplementary

353
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,955
materials to express a lot
of details that don't need

354
00:14:51,955 --> 00:14:53,330
to be part of the
main narrative,

355
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,850
and that is in effect
here a back door

356
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:59,980
allowing papers to be
of more variable length.

357
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,890
The biggest failing to
my mind of the conference

358
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:06,162
reviewing process is that
there's no revise and resubmit.

359
00:15:06,162 --> 00:15:07,870
That's the standard
we get from journals.

360
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,840
There's no chance for authors
to appeal to an editor

361
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,000
and interact with
an editor in a way

362
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,460
that you get from really
top quality journals.

363
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,350
And that just introduces
inefficiency into the system,

364
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,430
and it's a missed opportunity
for intellectual engagement

365
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:24,075
that could really
benefit the world.

366
00:15:24,075 --> 00:15:25,700
I do want to say,
though, there's hope.

367
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,920
The Transactions
of the ACL or TACL

368
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,860
is a journal that follows
the standard ACL conference

369
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,760
model fairly closely but allows
for journal-style interaction

370
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,930
with an editor.

371
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,600
I'm conflicted here, because
I've been a TACL action

372
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,100
editor for a very
long time, but I

373
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,070
do that work because I
think TACL is wonderful.

374
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,980
It's allowing for the
best aspects of our field

375
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,100
in terms of fast pace,
while also introducing

376
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,210
some healthy aspects of the
journal reviewing process.

377
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,960
TACL papers are a little
bit longer at ten pages,

378
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,370
so there's still some of
this problematic influence

379
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:01,847
under four here, but at
least they are a bit longer.

380
00:16:01,847 --> 00:16:04,430
And overall, I think it's just
a healthier rhythm for thinking

381
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,670
about evaluating work in
these scientific contexts,

382
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:12,760
so think about TACL as an
outlet for your work as well.

383
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,180
Let's focus on two
more specific topics

384
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,830
here and starting with titles.

385
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,560
And as I said before, a title
is an important ingredient

386
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,860
in the fate of your paper
in conference reviewing.

387
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,750
Jokey titles can
be risky, and I've

388
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,415
linked to some evidence for
that down here at this paper.

389
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,790
More importantly,
you might think

390
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:33,570
that it's important-- calibrate
the scope of your contribution

391
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,740
in your title.

392
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,020
It's a very common
complaint from reviewers

393
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,870
that the title is an overreach--
that it claims a broader

394
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,870
spectrum of the scientific
space than the paper actually

395
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,000
delivers on, and you
want to avoid that

396
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,470
by getting a tight alignment
between title and paper.

397
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,380
And then also consider
the kinds of reviewers

398
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,840
you're likely to attract
during that bidding process.

399
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,430
The choices you
make in your title

400
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,480
will definitely
influence that process,

401
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,330
and so you can again
think strategically

402
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:04,118
about who you want to pull
in as a reviewer because

403
00:17:04,118 --> 00:17:08,649
of their interest and
expertise and so forth.

404
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,240
I would also say
that it's worthwhile

405
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,760
avoiding special fonts and
formatting if possible,

406
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,550
just because it makes it harder
to consistently reproduce

407
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,690
your title.

408
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:19,839
That said, I am kind
of charmed by the move

409
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,490
to have emoji in
titles recently.

410
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,848
Jokey is risky,
but this can be fun

411
00:17:24,848 --> 00:17:26,709
and make your paper
a bit memorable,

412
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,630
even if it is harder
to copy and paste

413
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:32,220
the title in various contexts.

414
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,190
Abstracts-- abstracts are
also incredibly important,

415
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,320
because after the
title, they will

416
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,990
create this first and
lasting impression.

417
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,360
So here's a suggestion about
how to think about writing

418
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,970
abstracts-- the difficult form.

419
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,490
First, have your opening
be a broad overview--

420
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:51,160
a glimpse of the central
problem in its context.

421
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,550
Next, the middle takes
concepts mentioned

422
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,890
in the opening and
elaborates upon them,

423
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,350
probably by connecting
with specific experiments

424
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,370
and results from your paper.

425
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,950
And then finally,
at the very end,

426
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:05,070
establish links between
your proposal and broader

427
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:08,190
theoretical concerns so that
the reviewer on finishing

428
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,330
this abstract has an
answer to the question,

429
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:13,410
"Does the abstract offer
a substantial and original

430
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,980
proposal?"

431
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:19,080
So in a little more detail,
here's a kind of meta abstract.

432
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,020
"This opening sentence
situates you, dear reader.

433
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,020
Our approach seeks to address
the following central issue."

434
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,280
You spell it out.

435
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,180
"The techniques we
use are as follows."

436
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,470
And you spell it out.

437
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:32,352
"Our experiments are
these--" Details.

438
00:18:32,352 --> 00:18:33,810
And then finally,
"Overall, we find

439
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,090
that our approach has
the following properties,

440
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,900
and the significance
of this is--"

441
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,960
And if you just fill in
all those ellipsis dots,

442
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,110
I think you're pretty close
to an effective abstract,

443
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,970
and that's at least a
starting point for you

444
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,120
when you think about maybe
being more creative and fitting

445
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,400
this better to the
specifics of your ideas.

446
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,560
Style sheets-- this is
small but important.

447
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,130
This is the way that you could
avoid the dreaded desk reject.

448
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,140
Pay close attention
to the details

449
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,030
of the style sheet
for your conference

450
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,370
and any other requirements
included in the call

451
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:04,970
for papers.

452
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,450
It is worth your while to
read those documents carefully

453
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,730
and make sure you've
checked all the boxes.

454
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:15,020
In NLP, infractions are the
most likely cause of the dreaded

455
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,810
desk reject-- that is
rejection without review, which

456
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,420
is of course so disheartening,
because you made

457
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,520
a big push to get
your paper submitted,

458
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,260
and then shortly
thereafter you get

459
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,320
this desk reject in the mail,
and there's no recourse.

460
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,690
That's pretty much the end
of the process for you,

461
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,730
and you can avoid
it by just attending

462
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,395
to what they've
said in their style

463
00:19:33,395 --> 00:19:36,690
sheets and other guidelines.

464
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,120
And then finally, we
have this charming notion

465
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,980
of a camera-ready version.

466
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,200
This refers to
old-fashioned technology

467
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,880
for publishing papers
where you actually

468
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,920
needed to take
pictures of documents

469
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,240
in order to publish them.

470
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,020
Those days are long gone,
but the terminology remains.

471
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,150
For most NLP conferences,
as part of this

472
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,930
you get an additional
page upon acceptance.

473
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:00,133
This is presumably to respond
to requests made by reviewers.

474
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:02,550
Although in practice, you're
free to use the space however

475
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,630
you like.

476
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,930
In general, we find that
the extra page is mainly

477
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:11,520
used for fixing passages that we
made overly terse at reviewing

478
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,070
time in order to get
into the page limits,

479
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,750
and now, we're kind
of unpacking them

480
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,020
to make them more readable.

481
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,350
And this is obviously
an inefficient process,

482
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:23,100
but it's the reality at present.

483
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,130
You could, of course,
use your additional page

484
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,350
to improve your results
in all sorts of ways.

485
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,980
It's entirely up to you.

486
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:34,320
But a word of caution here, if
you have very substantially new

487
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,050
ideas and results,
it might be better

488
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:40,587
for you to save those for a
follow up paper as opposed

489
00:20:40,587 --> 00:20:43,170
to trying to pack them into work
that's already been accepted,

490
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,220
right?

491
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,170
Instead of just making
more work for yourself

492
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,940
as part of this
first contribution,

493
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,400
it might be that you're
on the exciting path

494
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,650
toward a follow-up
contribution that's

495
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,110
going to be its
entirely own new paper.

496
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:58,200
So think about that and
balance these pressures.

497
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,270
And then good luck with your
camera-ready submissions.

498
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:06,000
