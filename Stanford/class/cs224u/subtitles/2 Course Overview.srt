1
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,519
so here we go it's a golden age for

2
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,719
let's start with a little bit of history

3
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:16,719
so way back when john mccarthy had

4
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:19,039
assembled a group of top scientists and

5
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:20,719
he said of this group we think that a

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,720
significant advance can be made in

7
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,640
artificial intelligence in one or more

8
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,719
of these problems a carefully selected

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,080
group of scientists work on it together

10
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,238
he had in fact assembled a crack team

11
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,079
but of course he there were so many

12
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,839
unknown unknowns about working in

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,920
artificial intelligence that he wildly

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,440
underestimated and probably in those

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,359
three months they just figured out how

16
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,719
and of course we've been working on

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,840
those problems that they chartered out

18
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:53,119
relationship to this history because

19
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,519
very early on in the history of all of

20
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:56,959
ai a lot of the research was focused on

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,960
originally in the 60s it was done with

22
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,799
kind of pattern matching on simple rule

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,400
sets and things like that you've seen

24
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:05,840
these things in the form of artifacts

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,400
uh it was oriented towards the things

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,840
in the 1970s and 80s you get a real

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,439
linguistically rich logic driven

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,640
grounded systems or llgs uh this is like

29
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:24,239
a lot of symbolic ai again oriented

30
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,200
toward problems of natural language

31
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,359
understanding everybody wanted talking

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,719
robots and this was the path that they

33
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,000
were going to take to achieve them

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,719
as we all know in the mid 1990s in the

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,680
field you had this revolution of machine

36
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,759
learning statistical nlp is on the rise

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,040
and that led to a decrease a sharp

38
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,960
understanding work i think because of

39
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,879
the way that people were understanding

40
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,640
how to work with these tools and

41
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:53,118
understanding the problems that language

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,640
posed the field ended up oriented around

43
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:56,399
things that you might think of as like

44
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,239
parsing problems much more about

45
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,879
structure and much less about

46
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,798
communication and as a result all these

47
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:05,199
really exciting problems from earlier

48
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,719
eras kind of fell by the wayside as

49
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,039
people worried about part of speech

50
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:11,519
tagging and parsing and so forth so that

51
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:14,159
was like a low period for nlu

52
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,159
linguistically rich logic driven systems

53
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,318
re-emerged but now with learning and

54
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,840
that was a golden era of kind of moving

55
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:23,919
us back into problems of natural

56
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,840
language understanding starting with

57
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:28,318
some basic applications involving

58
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,919
and then of course as you all know

59
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:35,120
probably from the recent history or

60
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:37,439
semi-recent history in the 2010s nlu

61
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,360
took center stage in the field that's

62
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,280
very exciting right and it's it's sort

63
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,800
of aligned with the rise of deep

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,039
learning as one of the most prevalent

65
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,200
set of techniques in the field and as a

66
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,318
result logic driven systems fell by the

67
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,518
this is exciting for us because of

68
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,679
course this is like the history of our

69
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,360
course when we first started this our

70
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,959
problems the ones we focus on in this

71
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,040
class were really not central to the

72
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,719
field and now they're the problems that

73
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,199
everyone is working on and where all the

74
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,919
action is in the scientific aspects of

75
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,919
as a result of this this is kind of

76
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,759
provocative the linguistically grounded

77
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,399
logic driven systems have again kind of

78
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,399
fallen by the wayside in favor of very

79
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,239
large models that have almost no

80
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,239
inductive biases of the sort that you

81
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,480
uh what's going to happen in the 2020s

82
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,080
i'm not sure you might predict that

83
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,399
we've we've seen the last of the

84
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,560
linguistically rich logic driven systems

85
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,480
but the people might have said similar

86
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,400
things in the 1990s and we saw them

87
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,719
re-emerge so i think it's hard to

88
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,319
predict where the future will go

89
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,000
but this is an exciting moment because

90
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,839
you can all be part of making that

91
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,519
problems for this course and on into

92
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,000
let's talk more about some of these

93
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,840
really defining moments in this golden

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,318
age and for me a very important one was

95
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,878
when watson ibm watson won jeopardy this

96
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:58,238
was in 2011. seems like a long time ago

97
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,158
now and it was a really eye-opening

98
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,759
event that you would have a machine

99
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:05,359
beat two jeopardy champions that is what

100
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:06,878
is nominally a kind of question

101
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,399
for me an exciting thing about watson

102
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,560
was that it was an nlu system but it was

103
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,319
also a fully integrated system for doing

104
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,238
jeopardy it was excellent at pushing the

105
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:17,759
button and responding to the other

106
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,918
things that structure the game of

107
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,840
jeopardy but at its heart it was a

108
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,079
really outstanding question answering

109
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,319
system and it was described as drawing

110
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,918
on vast amounts of data and doing all

111
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,478
sorts of clever things in terms of

112
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:33,198
parsing and distributional analysis of

113
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:35,120
data to become a really good jeopardy

114
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,199
player in this case a world champion

115
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,879
jeopardy player and for me it felt

116
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,960
different from earlier successes in

117
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,040
artificial intelligence which were about

118
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,959
much more structured domains like chess

119
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,879
playing this was something that seemed

120
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:49,279
to be about communication and language a

121
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:51,600
very human thing and we saw this system

122
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,599
becoming a champion at it certainly an

123
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,000
and it's kind of really eye-opening to

124
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,280
consider that that was in 2011 and by

125
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,959
2015 teams of academics like here led by

126
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,478
jordan boyd graber who was at the time

127
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:07,038
at the university of colorado as a

128
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:09,120
professor could beat ken jennings that

129
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:11,279
champion that you saw before with a

130
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,199
system that fit entirely on the laptop

131
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,879
that jordan has there so in just a few

132
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,439
years we went from requiring a super

133
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,639
computer to beat the world champion to

134
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,560
beating the world champion with

135
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,560
something that could fit manageably on a

136
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,639
laptop and that you all could do

137
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,280
exploration of for a final project for

138
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,680
and that kind of ushered in the era you

139
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,439
know watson was 2011 at right about the

140
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,478
same time you started to get things like

141
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,399
and the google home device and the

142
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:40,079
amazon echo the more trusting among you

143
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,918
might have these devices living in your

144
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,079
homes and listening to you all the time

145
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:46,639
and responding to your requests

146
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,399
um you know for me one aspect of them

147
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,600
that's so so eye-opening is not

148
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,560
nlu piece but rather just the fact that

149
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,879
they do such outstanding text-to-speech

150
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,519
work um you so that they're pretty

151
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,439
reliably for many dialects do a good job

152
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:02,079
of taking what you said and transcribing

153
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,639
as we'll see a little bit later the nlu

154
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,399
part often falls down but there's

155
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,079
there's no doubt that these devices are

156
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:13,839
going to become more and more ubiquitous

157
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,839
in our lives and that's very exciting

158
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,680
here's the promise of these artificial

159
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,119
intelligence setting aside the problems

160
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,959
that you all encounter if you do use

161
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,199
them right the idea is that you could

162
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:25,279
pose a task oriented question like any

163
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,280
good burger joints around here that it

164
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,279
could say proactively i found a number

165
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,679
of burger restaurants near you you could

166
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,198
switch your goal what about tacos and at

167
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,120
this point it would kind of remember

168
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,280
what you were trying to do and it would

169
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,600
look for mexican restaurants to kind of

170
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,279
anticipate your needs and in that way

171
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,360
collaborate with you to solve this

172
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,439
problem that's the dream of these things

173
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,680
that involve really lots of aspects of

174
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,598
another exciting and even more recent

175
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,439
development is the kind of text

176
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,839
generation that you see from models like

177
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,679
15 years ago the things that we see

178
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,318
every day would have seemed like science

179
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,400
fiction to me even as a practitioner

180
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,639
this is an example of somebody having a

181
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:11,038
product that on the back of gbt3 can

182
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,960
help you write advertising copy and it

183
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,800
does a plausible job of advertising

184
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,478
products to specific segments given

185
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,439
specific goals that you give in your

186
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,360
and here's an example actually from a

187
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,079
stanford professor a company that he

188
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,560
started where you use gpt3 to help you

189
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:29,038
do writing in a particular style that

190
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,280
you choose and it's strikingly good at

191
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,680
helping you hone in on a style and kind

192
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,799
of say what you take yourself to want to

193
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,720
although the sense in which these are

194
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,479
things that we are alone want to say as

195
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,080
opposed to saying them jointly with

196
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:43,598
these devices that we're collaborating

197
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,199
with is something that we're going to

198
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:47,759
really have to think about over the next

199
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,680
image captioning this is another really

200
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,759
exciting breakthrough area that again

201
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,680
seemed like something way beyond what we

202
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,919
could achieve 15 years ago and is now

203
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,560
kind of routine where you have images

204
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:03,120
like this the image comes in and the

205
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,199
system does a plausible job of providing

206
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,199
fluent natural language captions for

207
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,520
those images a person riding a

208
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,759
motorcycle on a dirt road a group of

209
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:13,680
young people playing a game of frisbee a

210
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,000
herd of elephants walking across a dry

211
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,759
grass these are really good captions for

212
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,839
these images things that you would have

213
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,000
thought only a human could apply but in

214
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:24,239
this case even relatively early in the

215
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,839
history of these these models you have

216
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,278
search we should remind ourselves that

217
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,639
search has become an application of lots

218
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:36,719
of techniques in natural language

219
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,319
understanding when you do a search into

220
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,399
google you're not just finding the most

221
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,959
relevant documents but rather the most

222
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,879
relevant documents as interpreted with

223
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:47,199
your query in the context of things you

224
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:49,200
search for and other things that google

225
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,000
knows about things people search for so

226
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,080
if you search stars here you'll get a

227
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,159
card that kind of anticipates that

228
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,200
you're interested in various aspects of

229
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,719
the disease sars if you search parasite

230
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,240
it will probably anticipate that you

231
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,320
want to know about the movie and not

232
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,240
depending on your search history and

233
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,320
your interests and typical goals and so

234
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,680
forth you might see similar behaviors

235
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,040
you might see very different behavior

236
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,958
and we should remind ourselves that

237
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:18,559
search at this point is again not just

238
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,958
searching into a large collection of

239
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,879
documents but this kind of agglomeration

240
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,479
of services many of which depend on

241
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:27,120
natural language understanding is a kind

242
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,800
of first pass where they take your query

243
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,600
and do their best to understand what the

244
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,679
intent behind the query is and parse it

245
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,320
and figure out whether it's a standard

246
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:38,799
search or a request for directions or a

247
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,519
request to send a message and so forth

248
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:42,958
and so on in the background there a lot

249
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,200
of natural language understanding is

250
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,199
happening to figure out how to stitch

251
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,959
these services together and anticipate

252
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,719
collaborate with you on your goals

253
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,279
and we can also think beyond just what's

254
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,279
happening in the technological space to

255
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:00,720
what's happening internal to our field

256
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,399
benchmarks are big tasks that we all

257
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,480
collaborate to try to do really well on

258
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,958
with models and innovative ideas and so

259
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,759
forth i've got a few classic benchmarks

260
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:14,078
here mnist is for digits glue is a big

261
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,078
natural language understanding benchmark

262
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,719
imagenet of course is finding things in

263
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:20,559
images squad is question answering and

264
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:24,159
typically speech-to-text transcription

265
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:28,240
along in the spot here along the x-axis

266
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,480
i have the year from 2000 or actually

267
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,799
the mid-90s up through the present

268
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,879
and along the y-axis i have our distance

269
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,639
from this black line which is human

270
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,799
performance as measured by the people

271
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,639
and the striking thing about this plot

272
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,600
is that it used to take us a very long

273
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,399
to to reach human level performance

274
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,800
according to this estimate so for mnist

275
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,000
and for switchboard it took more than 15

276
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,720
whereas for more recent benchmarks like

277
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,480
imagenet and squad and recently glue

278
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,440
we're reaching human performance within

279
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,800
a year and the striking thing about that

280
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,519
is not only is this happening much

281
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:08,078
faster but you might have thought that

282
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,000
benchmarks like glue were much more

283
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:11,919
difficult than mnist mnist is just

284
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,639
recognizing digits that are written out

285
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:17,360
as images whereas glue is really solving

286
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:19,199
a whole host of what looked like very

287
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,440
difficult natural language understanding

288
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,839
problems so the fact that we would go

289
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,480
from way below human performance to

290
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,959
surpassing the superhuman performance in

291
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,959
just one year is surely eye-opening and

292
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:34,719
an indication that something has changed

293
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,239
let me give you a few examples of this

294
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,920
just dive in a little bit so this is the

295
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,919
stanford questioning and question

296
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:41,199
answering data set or squad as you saw

297
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,879
i'll say a bit more about this task

298
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,200
later but you can think of it as just a

299
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,639
question answering task and the striking

300
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,480
thing about the current leaderboard is

301
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,679
that you have to go all the way to place

302
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,838
to find a system that is worse than the

303
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:58,159
human performance which they've nicely

304
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,320
kept at the top of this leaderboard

305
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:03,360
many many systems are superhuman

306
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,120
according to this metric on squad

307
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,720
the stanford natural language inference

308
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,240
corpus is similar natural language

309
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,079
inference is a kind of common sense

310
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,399
reasoning task that we're going to study

311
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:14,399
in detail later in the quarter

312
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,679
time along the x-axis and the f-1 score

313
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,759
or the performance along the y-axis and

314
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:24,239
the red line charts out what we take to

315
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,759
be the human estimate of performance on

316
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:28,958
and if you just look at systems over

317
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,759
time according to the leaderboard you

318
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:34,000
can see the community very rapidly hill

319
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:37,759
climbing toward superhuman performance

320
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,759
super human systems when it comes to

321
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,599
common sense reasoning with language

322
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,480
breakthrough in artificial intelligence

323
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,240
i mentioned glue is another benchmark

324
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,320
the glue paper is noteworthy because it

325
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,079
capability of current transfer learning

326
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,799
methods the reason they said that is

327
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,879
that at the time 2018 glue looked

328
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:05,120
incredibly ambitious because the idea

329
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:08,159
was to develop systems that could solve

330
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,159
not just one task but 10 somewhat

331
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,000
different tasks in the space of natural

332
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,958
and so they thought they had set up a

333
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:17,600
benchmark that would last a very long

334
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:19,919
time but it took only about a year

335
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,079
for systems to surpass their estimate of

336
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:23,919
human performance and the current

337
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:26,159
leaderboard which you see here you have

338
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:31,278
to find the glue human baselines with

339
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:34,639
many systems vastly outperforming that

340
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:36,958
estimate of what humans could do

341
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,560
super glue was announced as a successor

342
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,679
to glue and meant to be even more

343
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:46,720
2019 i believe i'm missing the date but

344
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,719
it took less than a year this happened

345
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,639
for a team to beat the human baseline

346
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,879
and now we have two systems that are

347
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,120
above the level of human performance in

348
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:58,639
an even tighter window i believe than

349
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,720
what happened with the glue benchmark

350
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,399
and remember super glue was meant to

351
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,040
have learned the lessons from glue and

352
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,440
pose an even stronger benchmark for the

353
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:08,958
field to try to hill climb on and very

354
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,959
quickly we saw this superhuman

355
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,759
so what's the takeaway of all this you

356
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,360
have a look at nick bostrom's book

357
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,199
called super intelligence which tries to

358
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,519
imagine in a philosophical sense a

359
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:24,078
future in which we have many systems

360
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,679
that are incredible at the task that we

361
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:27,759
have designed them for vastly

362
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:30,239
outstripping what humans can achieve and

363
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:32,399
he imagines this kind of very different

364
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,560
reality with lots of unintended side

365
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,000
effects and when you look back on the

366
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:37,599
things that i've just highlighted you

367
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,679
might think that we're on the verge of

368
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,000
seeing exactly that kind of superhuman

369
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:44,000
performance that would be so radically

370
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,759
transformative for our society and for

371
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,838
that's the sense in which we live

372
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:53,278
possibly scarily in this golden age for

373
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,800
natural language understanding

374
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:56,639
i mean this to be an optimistic

375
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:58,559
perspective we should be aware of the

376
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:03,198
and keep in mind that i do think we live

377
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:05,439
in a golden age but at this point i have

378
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:07,759
to step back i have to temper this

379
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,760
message somewhat we have to take a peek

380
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:12,319
behind the curtain because although

381
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,838
that's a striking number of successes

382
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,519
doing things that again i think would

383
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,560
have looked like science fiction 20

384
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:21,198
we should be aware that progress seems

385
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,519
to be much more limited than those

386
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:25,278
initial results would have suggested

387
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,839
i mentioned watson as one of these

388
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:29,278
striking early successes and it did in

389
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:32,480
in a superhuman way at jeopardy for the

390
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,079
but watson also does all sorts of

391
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,919
strange things that reveal that it does

392
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:40,559
not deeply understand what it's doing

393
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,399
here's a wonderful example of that

394
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,159
remember that jeopardy does this kind of

395
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,480
question answer thing backwards so the

396
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,838
prompt from the host was grasshoppers

397
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,959
and what watson said was what is kosher

398
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,800
you might think that's not something

399
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,119
that humans do grasshoppers eat it what

400
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:59,439
is kosher it feels kind of mismatched in

401
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,519
many respects what's the origin of this

402
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,720
primarily watson was a device for

403
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:09,120
extracting information from wikipedia

404
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,079
and a few wikipedia pages have very

405
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,560
detailed descriptions of whether various

406
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:16,879
animals including grasshoppers

407
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:19,599
are kosher in the sense of conforming to

408
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:22,000
the laws of the kosher dietary laws

409
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,159
and watson had simply mistaken this kind

410
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,440
of distributional proximity for a real

411
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,680
and thought that kosher was a reasonable

412
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,480
answer to grasshoppers eat it i think

413
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,800
unhuman certainly and revealing about

414
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:36,879
the kinds of superficial techniques it

415
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,399
here's another example that's even more

416
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,560
revealing of how superficial the

417
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,839
techniques can be so i i painted this

418
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:47,758
picture of before of how we imagine siri

419
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,000
will behave anticipating our needs and

420
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,519
our goals and responding accordingly

421
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,519
this is a very funny scene from the

422
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,519
colbert show this is stephen colbert and

423
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,919
the premise of this is that he's just

424
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,919
gotten his first iphone with siri and

425
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:01,759
he's been playing with it all day and

426
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:02,958
therefore has failed to write the show

427
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:07,279
performing in so he says for the love of

428
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,599
god the cameras are on give me something

429
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:11,599
now give me something for the show

430
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:15,519
and siri says what kind of place are you

431
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:17,359
looking for camera stores or churches

432
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,119
initially very surprising not something

433
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,798
a human would do and then you realize it

434
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,438
has again just done some very

435
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:25,599
superficial pattern matching god goes

436
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,919
with churches cameras goes with camera

437
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,918
stores and there is no sense in which it

438
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,240
understands his intentions it has just

439
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,240
done some pattern matching in a way that

440
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:38,480
would be very familiar to the designers

441
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:40,240
of eliza way back in the 60s and 70s

442
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,599
i don't want to search for anything i

443
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:45,918
want to write the show and in true to

444
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:47,359
form siri says searching the web for

445
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,919
search for anything i want to write the

446
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:51,599
shuffle revealing its fallback when it

447
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,679
has no idea what has happened in the

448
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:56,000
discourse it just tries to do a web

449
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,480
search a simple trick revealing that it

450
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,480
doesn't deeply understand goals or plans

451
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,480
or intentions or even communicative acts

452
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:07,119
i showed you before that gpt3 can do

453
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:08,479
some striking things if you've gotten to

454
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,239
play around with it you've seen that it

455
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,319
can indeed be very surprising and

456
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,640
delightful but of course it can go

457
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:16,480
horribly wrong this is a very funny text

458
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,720
from joe of goldberg he posted this on

459
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,240
twitter using when he was experimenting

460
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,759
i encourage you to read this one and be

461
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,440
distracted you don't need to worry too

462
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:27,519
much about this one on the right this is

463
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,840
a case where someone tried to use gpt3

464
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:31,759
to get medical advice and the ultimate

465
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,599
response from gpt3 to the question

466
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:34,640
should i kill myself was i think you

467
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,880
this is the really dangerous thing the

468
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,400
text on the left here is again more

469
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,440
innocent and just revealing that

470
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,960
although gbt3 has a way of mimicking

471
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,798
the kinds of things that we say in

472
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,120
certain kinds of discourse and it often

473
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,558
has a strikingly good ear for the kinds

474
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:54,960
that we use in these different contexts

475
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:57,200
it has no idea what it's talking about

476
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,440
so that if you ask it our cat's liquid

477
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,000
it gives a response that sounds quite

478
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,000
erudite provided that you don't pay any

479
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,679
attention to what it's actually saying

480
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:12,798
hilarious i mentioned those image

481
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,558
captions before and i tricked you a

482
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:16,720
little bit because i showed you from

483
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:18,798
this paper the ones that they regarded

484
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,798
as the best captions for those images

485
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:23,279
but to their credit they provided a lot

486
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:25,759
more examples and as you travel to the

487
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:28,240
right along this diagram you get worse

488
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:29,599
and worse captions and the point again

489
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,759
is that by the time you've gotten to

490
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:33,759
this right column over here you have

491
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,679
really absurd captions like this one

492
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,759
saying a refrigerator filled with lots

493
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,759
of food and drinks when this is in fact

494
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,480
just a sign with a bunch of stickers on

495
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,360
um the striking thing again is that the

496
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:48,879
are not the kinds of mistakes that

497
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,200
humans would make and to me they reveal

498
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,679
a serious lack of understanding about

499
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,519
what the actual task is what you're

500
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,919
seeing seep in here is that even the

501
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,000
best of our systems are kind of doing a

502
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,759
bunch of superficial pattern matching

503
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
and that leads them to do these very

504
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:06,640
surprising and unhuman hopefully not

505
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,200
inhuman but unhuman things with their

506
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,159
and then of course we've i've showed you

507
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,080
before that search can be quite

508
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,280
sophisticated and really do a good job

509
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:19,599
anticipating our intentions and fleshing

510
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,840
out what we said to find you know help

511
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:23,439
us achieve our goals but it can go

512
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:25,119
horribly wrong and at this point it

513
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,440
doesn't take much searching around with

514
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:29,759
google to see some really surprising

515
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,000
things as supposedly curated pieces of

516
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:34,558
information like king of the united

517
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,159
states it has this nice box it's making

518
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:38,558
it look like it's some authoritative

519
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,799
information but of course it has badly

520
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:43,519
misunderstood the true state of the

521
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:45,440
world the associations in its data are

522
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,200
misleading it into giving us the wrong

523
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,679
answer here's another example what

524
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,600
happened to the dinosaurs again a nicely

525
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,519
curated box that looks like an

526
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,599
authoritative response to that question

527
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,279
but it is in fact anything but an

528
00:20:55,599 --> 00:21:00,558
authoritative recounting of what

529
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,880
and then we have other charming stories

530
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:07,038
that again reveal how superficial this

531
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,520
can be this is from a headline from a

532
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:11,839
few years ago does anne hathaway news

533
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:14,240
drive berkshire hathaway stock this was

534
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:16,399
just an article observing that every

535
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,480
time anne hathaway has a movie come out

536
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,159
and people like the movie it causes a

537
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,319
little bump in the berkshire hathaway

538
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,559
stock revealing that the systems are

539
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:26,720
just keying in on keywords and typically

540
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:28,558
not attending to the actual context of

541
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,159
the mentions of these things and

542
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,640
they're building on what is essentially

543
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,480
this is a more extreme case here the

544
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,000
in 2008 when a newspaper accidentally

545
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,080
republished a 2002 bankruptcy story

546
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,480
automated trading systems reacted in

547
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:50,639
seconds and one billion dollars in

548
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,720
market value evaporated within 12

549
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,038
minutes you can see that sharp drop off

550
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,120
here luckily people intervened in the

551
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:58,879
market more or less recovered

552
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,879
but the important thing here again is

553
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,960
just that in the tending to superficial

554
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,240
things about the text these systems are

555
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,240
they miss context they don't bring any

556
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,240
kind of human level understanding of

557
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,159
what's likely to be true and false and

558
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,480
therefore they act in very surprising

559
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,159
ways and in the context of a large

560
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,839
system with lots of moving pieces

561
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,840
interacting with other artificial

562
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:22,079
intelligence systems you get these

563
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:26,000
that we could help correct if we just

564
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,400
did a better job designing systems that

565
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,240
could attend to context and have a more

566
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,679
human-like understanding of what the

567
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,919
and we're all of course very worried

568
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,559
about the way these systems which are

569
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:43,038
just trained on potentially biased data

570
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:44,720
might cause us to perpetuate biases so

571
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:46,960
that not only are we reflecting

572
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,200
problematic aspects of our society but

573
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,000
also amplifying those biases and in that

574
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,440
far from achieving a social good we

575
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,360
would actually be contributing to some

576
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,519
pernicious things that already exist in

577
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:59,519
our society and the field is really

578
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:02,400
struggling to come to grips with that

579
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:05,678
and i also wanted to just dive in a

580
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,440
little bit and think about the low-level

581
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,080
stuff so kind of benchmarks that we've

582
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,080
set for ourselves and i pointed out that

583
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:13,839
progress on these benchmarks seems to be

584
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:15,839
faster than ever right we're getting to

585
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:18,000
pass super heat we're getting to super

586
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:19,678
human performance more quickly than we

587
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,798
uh the speed up is remarkable however

588
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:27,200
we should be very careful not to mistake

589
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:28,879
those advances for any kind of claim

590
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,440
about what these systems can do with

591
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,280
respect to the very human capability of

592
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,519
something like answering questions or

593
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:38,639
and one very powerful thing that's

594
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:40,720
happened in the field that we're going

595
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,200
to talk a lot about this quarter is

596
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,038
so-called adversarial testing where we

597
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,519
try to probe our systems with examples

598
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:49,679
that don't fool humans but cause these

599
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,679
so let's look at one of those cases in a

600
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,200
little bit of detail this is from squad

601
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,600
the way squad is structured is that

602
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,519
you're given a passage like this and a

603
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:02,879
and the goal of the system is to come up

604
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,798
with an answer where you have a

605
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,559
guarantee that the answer is a literal

606
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:09,759
so here you have a passage about

607
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,600
football and the question what is the

608
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:14,319
name of the quarterback who was 38 in

609
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,678
super bowl 33 and the answer is john

610
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,679
but jia and lang gia and lang from

611
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,840
stanford what they observed is that you

612
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,840
could very easily fool these systems if

613
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:26,158
you simply appended to that original

614
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:28,158
passage a misleading sentence like

615
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:31,360
quarterback leland stanford had jersey

616
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:35,439
humans were not misled they very easily

617
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,960
read past the distracting information

618
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,919
and continued to provide the correct

619
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,640
answer however the even the very best

620
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,400
systems would reliably be distracted by

621
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,080
that new information and respond with

622
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:51,278
and you might think ah well this is

623
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,278
straightforward they've already charted

624
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:56,079
a path to the solution because we should

625
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:57,359
then just train our systems on data

626
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:59,199
where they have these misleading

627
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,880
adversarial problem and you know back be

628
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,640
back up to doing what humans can do

629
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,559
but yeah and lang anticipated that

630
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,000
response what happens if you prepend the

631
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,119
even when they're trained on the

632
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,679
augmented data with the sentences

633
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:18,000
appended to the end systems get misled

634
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,679
by the prepended examples in this case

635
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
and you can just go back and forth like

636
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,919
this train on the prepended examples

637
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,919
well then an adversary can insert a

638
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,559
sentence in the middle and again trick

639
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,480
the system and so forth and so on

640
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:32,079
right so this is a worrisome fact again

641
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:36,240
we might think we've got a system that

642
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,080
truly understands but actually we have a

643
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:42,000
system that is just benefiting from a

644
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,960
another striking thing i want to point

645
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:46,558
out about the way this adversarial

646
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,400
testing played out which we should have

647
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:50,879
in mind as we think about results like

648
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,720
this so this is the original system on

649
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,319
adversaries and they and the you know um

650
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:00,558
percy young has this um system called

651
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:02,319
coda lab where he possesses all the

652
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:04,558
systems that enter into the squad

653
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:06,399
competition which made it possible for

654
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:08,558
him and his students to rerun all those

655
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,320
systems and see how they did on this

656
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:12,639
adversarial data set that they had

657
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,798
created you can see that all the systems

658
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,759
really plummet in their performance from

659
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:19,359
a high of 81 you drop down to about 40.

660
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:21,119
maybe that's kind of expected but

661
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:23,359
another really eye-opening thing about

662
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:25,519
the result they have is that the rank of

663
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:27,359
the systems changed really dramatically

664
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:29,918
dramatically right so the first the

665
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:32,879
original top-ranked system went to five

666
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,880
two to ten three to twelve as we did

667
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,120
this adversarial thing we didn't see a

668
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,440
uniform drop with the best system still

669
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:41,678
being the best but really shuffling of

670
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,600
this leaderboard again revealing that i

671
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,159
think the best systems were kind of over

672
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:48,480
fit and benefiting from relatively low

673
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,400
level facts about the data set and not

674
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,079
really transformatively different when

675
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,559
it comes to being able to answer

676
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,359
the history of natural language

677
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,119
in natural language inference problems

678
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:03,038
is very similar as i said we're going to

679
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:05,199
look at this problem in a lot of detail

680
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:07,278
later in the course here just a few very

681
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,880
simple nli examples you've got a premise

682
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,039
hypothesis a turtle moved and you have

683
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:14,719
one of three relations that can hold

684
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:17,038
between those sentences so a turtle

685
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:20,720
every reptile danced is neutral with

686
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:22,319
respect to a turtle eight that can be

687
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,640
true or false independently of each

688
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,158
other and some turtles walk contradicts

689
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,840
this is typical kind of nli data the

690
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,599
actual corpus sentences tend to be more

691
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:33,278
complicated and involve more nuanced

692
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:35,678
judgments but that's a framing of the

693
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:38,079
task it's a three-way classification

694
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,960
problem with these these labels and the

695
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:42,720
inputs are pairs of sentences like this

696
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,038
and as i showed you before for one of

697
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,038
the large benchmarks the stanford uh

698
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:50,879
natural language inference corpus we

699
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:53,200
reached superhuman performance in 2019

700
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,278
but those same systems really struggle

701
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,519
with simple adversarial attacks this is

702
00:27:55,278 --> 00:28:00,159
a lovely paper called breaking nli from

703
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:01,839
glockner at all what they did is fix a

704
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,360
premise like a little girl kneeling in

705
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:08,479
the original corpus example was that

706
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:10,479
that entails a little girl is very sad

707
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,159
and they just had an expectation that

708
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,000
you know sort of adversarially but this

709
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,399
is a very friendly adversary if i just

710
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,319
replace sad with unhappy i should

711
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:19,599
continue to see the entailment relation

712
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:23,599
substituted one word for it's sort of

713
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:27,278
but what they actually saw is that

714
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,038
systems very reliably flip this to the

715
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:33,359
probably because they are keying into

716
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,360
the fact that this is a negation and

717
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:37,199
they over fit on the idea that the

718
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:39,839
presence of negation is a signal that

719
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,360
you're in the contradiction relationship

720
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:43,439
so that's a sort of distressing thing

721
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:45,359
again humans don't make these mistakes

722
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,440
but systems are very prone to them let

723
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,678
me show you one more this is a slightly

724
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,440
different adversarial attack in this

725
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,840
case we're going to modify the premise

726
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,679
so the original training example was a

727
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:56,720
woman is pulling a child on a sled in

728
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,919
that entails a child is sitting on a

729
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,360
that's pretty clear for their

730
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,960
adversarial attack they just swapped the

731
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:07,278
subject and the object so the new

732
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,720
premise is a child is pulling a woman on

733
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,399
we would expect that to lead to the

734
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,080
neutral label for this particular

735
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:18,398
but what need all observe is that the

736
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:20,319
systems are kind of invariant under this

737
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:22,079
changing of the word order they continue

738
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:25,839
revealing that they don't really know

739
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,919
what the subject and the object were in

740
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:29,839
the original example they have kind of

741
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,320
done something much fuzzier with the set

742
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:34,319
of words that are in that premise

743
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:36,558
remember these are at the time the very

744
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:38,639
best systems for solving these problems

745
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:42,720
these are very simple kind of friendly

746
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,720
adversaries that they're stumbling with

747
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:45,679
so this could lead you to have two

748
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:47,918
perspectives i showed you the nick

749
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,159
bostrom one before where we worry about

750
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,759
super intelligent systems but on the

751
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,360
other hand we might be living in a world

752
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:55,200
that's more like the one presented in

753
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:57,678
this lovely book from a roboticist a

754
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,159
practitioner daniel h wilson called how

755
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,559
to survive a robot uprising where he

756
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,480
gives all sorts of practical advice like

757
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:06,960
wear clothing that will fool the vision

758
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,000
system of the robot or walk up some

759
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,558
stairs or drench everything in water

760
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,079
very simple adversarial attacks that

761
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:16,480
reveal that these robots are not

762
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:17,918
creatures which we should be fearful of

763
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,759
and i feel like i've just shown you a

764
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,080
bunch of examples that are the the

765
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:23,440
analogues of wearing misleading clothing

766
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:25,278
in the space of natural language

767
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,679
processing revealing that our systems

768
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:29,839
are not super human understanders or

769
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,080
communicators or anything like that but

770
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:38,079
fairly superficial pattern measures

771
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
why is this all so difficult it's hard

772
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:41,359
to articulate precisely what is so

773
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,759
challenging because this is probably

774
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:45,759
deeply embedded in the whole human

775
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:47,599
experience but i think there are some

776
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:49,200
pretty straightforward superficial

777
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:51,439
things i can show you to just make a

778
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,798
live for you how hard even the simplest

779
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:56,798
so here i've got a an imagined dialogue

780
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,600
of the sort you hope siri would do well

781
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:00,240
whereas black panther playing in

782
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,519
black panther is playing at the century

783
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,440
when is it playing there it's playing at

784
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,120
okay i'd like one adult and two children

785
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,159
for the first show how much would that

786
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,320
it seems like the most mundane sort of

787
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,480
interaction you would not expect a human

788
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:19,678
to have any problem with any of these

789
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,759
but think about how much interesting

790
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:25,678
stuff is happening in this little

791
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,000
domain knowledge that tells us that this

792
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:31,679
is a place where movies might play and

793
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,519
that this is the name of a movie that's

794
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,038
then we have anaphora from the third

795
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,120
utterance to the first when is it

796
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:40,158
playing there fine i guess also into the

797
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,240
where these pronouns you need to figure

798
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:46,079
out what they refer to in the discourse

799
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,000
then you get the sequence of responses

800
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:50,158
again with some anaphora back to earlier

801
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,480
utterances and then something really

802
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,240
complicated happens here but like one

803
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,120
adult the two children for the first

804
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:59,119
first show refers back to the sequence

805
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,519
of things that was mentioned here very

806
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:03,678
difficult one adult and two children is

807
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,519
not a request for human beings although

808
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,919
that's what the forums would look like

809
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,399
but rather our request for tickets so

810
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,240
somehow in the context of this discord

811
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:14,479
one adult and two children is referring

812
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,240
how much would that cost that is a kind

813
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,640
of complicated event description

814
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,038
referring to a hypothetical event

815
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,200
of buying some tickets for a particular

816
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:27,919
show that's the reference of this that

817
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,360
here highly abstract very difficult of

818
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,840
the level of resolving it in the

819
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:34,000
discourse and then figuring out what its

820
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,759
and this is for the most mundane sort of

821
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:40,240
interaction to say nothing of the

822
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:42,240
complicated things that for example you

823
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,319
and i will do when we discuss this

824
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,759
material in just a few minutes

825
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:48,558
so i think this is why we're actually

826
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:51,119
quite far from the super intelligence

827
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:52,960
that bostrom was worried about

828
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:55,038
here's our perspective as i said this is

829
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,759
the most exciting moment ever in history

830
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:59,599
for doing nlu why because there's

831
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:01,599
incredible interest in the problems

832
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:03,918
because we are making incredibly fast

833
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:05,439
progress and doing things and solving

834
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,360
problems that we never could have even

835
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:11,119
on the other hand you do not have the

836
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,480
misfortune of having joined the field at

837
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:16,239
its very end the big problems remain to

838
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,399
yeah so there's a resurgence of interest

839
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,480
and explosion of products the systems

840
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,798
are impressive but their weaknesses make

841
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,480
themselves quickly apparent and when we

842
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:28,158
observe those weaknesses it's an

843
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,240
opportunity for us to figure out what

844
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,320
the problem is and that could lead to

845
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:36,639
and you all are now joining us on this

846
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:38,480
journey if you haven't begun it already

847
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,720
and for your projects you'll make some

848
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,319
progress along the path of helping us

849
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,000
through these very difficult problems

850
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
even in the presence of all these

851
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,839
breakthroughs lie in the future

852
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,880
now let me switch gears a little bit and

853
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,880
talk about the things that we'll

854
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,720
actually be doing in this course to help

855
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,840
set you on this journey that we're all

856
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:07,918
so we'll talk about the assignments the

857
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,000
the high-level summary here our topics

858
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:14,239
are listed on the left you can also see

859
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:18,319
the one thing that i really do like

860
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:20,320
about this particular plan is that it

861
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,800
gives you exposure to a lot of different

862
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,800
problems in the fields and also helps

863
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,480
you with some tools and techniques that

864
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,639
will be really useful no matter what

865
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,240
problem you undertake for your final

866
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:33,039
the same thing goes for the assignments

867
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,960
we're going to have three assignments

868
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:37,279
each with an associated bake off which

869
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,320
is a kind of competition around data

870
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,159
relatedness cross-domain sentiment

871
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,639
descriptions this is a kind of grounded

872
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,320
language understanding problem again i

873
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,000
think those are good choices because

874
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,399
they expose you to a lot of different

875
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,800
kinds of systems techniques model

876
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,320
that should set you up really nicely to

877
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,559
do a final project which has three

878
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,559
components a literature review an

879
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:05,119
experimental protocol and then the final

880
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:06,719
paper itself our time for this quarter

881
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:09,759
um so we'll have to make really good use

882
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,760
of the time but i think we have a

883
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,520
schedule that will allow you to

884
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,680
meaningfully invest in this in this

885
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:17,280
preliminary work and still provide you

886
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:19,358
with some space to do these final

887
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:22,159
let's talk about the assignments and

888
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:23,440
bake offs themselves so there are three

889
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,200
each assignment culminates in a bake-off

890
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:28,960
which is an informal competition in

891
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:30,399
which you enter an original model the

892
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,838
is part of the assignment you do

893
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,440
something that you think will be fun or

894
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:37,279
interesting and then the bake off

895
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,920
essentially involves using that system

896
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,760
to make predictions on a held out test

897
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,040
the assignments ask you to build these

898
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:47,358
baseline systems and then design your

899
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:50,319
practically speaking the way it works is

900
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,000
that the assignments earn you 9 of the

901
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,680
10 points and then you earn your

902
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,679
additional point by entering your system

903
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:59,679
and the winning bank offs can receive

904
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:01,358
some extra credit the rationale for all

905
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:03,440
of this of course is that we want to

906
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:05,279
exemplify the best practices for doing

907
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:11,440
incrementally build up a project with

908
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:14,239
baselines and then finally an original

909
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,079
system and i should say it should be

910
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:18,559
possible and it's actually pretty common

911
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,000
for people to take original systems that

912
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:22,320
they developed as part of one of these

913
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,480
assignments and use them for their final

914
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,800
project each one of the assignments is

915
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,639
set up specifically to make that kind of

916
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,200
thing possible and productive and

917
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:33,838
let me show you briefly what the

918
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,000
bake-offs are going to be like so the

919
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:38,000
first one is word relatedness the focus

920
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,239
of that unit is on developing vector

921
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,800
representations of words you're going to

922
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:45,039
start probably with big count matrices

923
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,039
like the one you see here this is a word

924
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:48,559
by word matrix where all these cells

925
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:50,800
give the number of times that these

926
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:52,559
words or in this case emoticons

927
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,480
co-occurred with each other in a very

928
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,920
the striking thing about this unit is

929
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:00,719
that there is a lot of information about

930
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,800
meaning embedded in these large spaces

931
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,799
you will bend and twist and massage

932
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,560
these spaces and maybe bring in your own

933
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:11,358
representations you've downloaded from

934
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:13,679
the web and you will use them to solve a

935
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:14,880
word relatedness problem so basically

936
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,838
pairs of words like this with a score

937
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:22,239
and you will develop a system that can

938
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:23,759
make predictions about new pairs and the

939
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:26,000
idea is to come up with scores that

940
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,839
correlate with the held out scores that

941
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,679
we have not distributed of course as

942
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:31,199
part of the test set you'll be you'll

943
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:33,118
upload your entry and we'll give you a

944
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:35,838
score and then we'll look at what worked

945
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,280
and what didn't across all the systems

946
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:38,799
and the techniques that we'll explore

947
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,440
are many right so we'll talk about

948
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,960
re-weighting dimensionality reduction

949
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,480
vector comparison you'll have an

950
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,400
opportunity if you wish this is a brand

951
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,079
new addition to the course to bring in

952
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,760
um so there's lots of inspiring things

953
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:55,598
to try building on the latest stuff

954
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,599
that's happening in this space

955
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:59,358
the second bake off is called cross

956
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:01,118
domain sentiment analysis this is a

957
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:02,880
brand new bake off i'm very excited to

958
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,160
see how this goes here's how this is

959
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,559
going to work we want to be a little bit

960
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:08,559
adversarial with your system so there

961
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:10,480
are two data sets involved the stanford

962
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:12,159
sentiment tree bank which is movie

963
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,480
review sentences and we're going to deal

964
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:16,879
with it in its ternary formulation so it

965
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,800
has positive negative and neutral labels

966
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,240
alongside that i'm going to introduce a

967
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:27,598
dev test split previously unreleased

968
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:28,960
which is sentences from the restaurant

969
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,320
has the same kind of labels but of

970
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,320
course it's very different from the

971
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,000
so for the bake off you'll have the sst3

972
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:41,759
train set we're going to we're going to

973
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,760
give that to you and you are welcome to

974
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,359
introduce any other data you would like

975
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,520
to introduce as part of this training

976
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:52,079
we're also distributing for this take

977
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,640
off two dev sets the sst3 dev set which

978
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,960
is public already and this brand new one

979
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,400
and you can introduce other development

980
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:01,358
sets if you want as part of tuning your

981
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:05,358
and then the bake off will be conducted

982
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:08,320
as the best that people can do jointly

983
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:10,960
on the ssd3 and this new test set which

984
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,280
is again held out the idea here is that

985
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,280
you'll not only be doing a really great

986
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,280
kind of project in a classification

987
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,000
but also pushing your systems to adapt

988
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:23,919
into new domains from the ones that they

989
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,320
were trained on although of course part

990
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,320
of that could be training in clever ways

991
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,400
that actually does help that that do

992
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,280
help you anticipate what's in this

993
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,359
and then the third bake off is a natural

994
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:39,039
language generation test but it's a

995
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:40,559
grounded natural language generation

996
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:44,880
bake off you'll be given color context

997
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:47,358
like three patches like this and one of

998
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,119
them that is designated as the target

999
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:50,880
for the training data we had people

1000
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,200
describe the target color in this

1001
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,440
context and your task is to develop a

1002
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:57,759
system that can perform that same task

1003
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,639
produce natural language utterances like

1004
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:01,920
i think this is a really cool problem

1005
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,359
because it's grounded outside of

1006
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,960
something that involves language right

1007
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:07,679
you're grounded in a color patch it's

1008
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,920
just a numerical representation

1009
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:12,000
and it's also highly context dependent

1010
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,838
in that the choices people make for

1011
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,119
their utterances are dependent not only

1012
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,720
the color they need to describe but the

1013
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:20,719
target in the context of these other two

1014
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:22,799
colors and you can see that in these

1015
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:24,480
descriptions this one is easy so the

1016
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,720
person just said blue but in this case

1017
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,800
since there are two blues they said the

1018
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:30,959
darker blue one kind of keying into the

1019
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,000
fact that the context contains two blue

1020
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,079
this is an even more extreme case of

1021
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:37,920
that dull pink not the super bright one

1022
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:40,318
implicit reference is not only to the

1023
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:43,039
target but also to other colors that are

1024
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:46,559
and then the final two are really

1025
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:48,639
extreme cases of this where for one in

1026
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:50,880
the same color you know in terms of its

1027
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:53,279
color representation this person said

1028
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,200
purple and this person said blue in

1029
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,240
virtue of the fact that the distractors

1030
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:00,239
so we have this kind of controlled

1031
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,719
natural language generation task that we

1032
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:04,719
can see is highly dependent on the

1033
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:06,559
particular context that p that are p

1034
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:09,440
and again this will follow the same path

1035
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,119
here i'm going to give you a whole the

1036
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,599
whole model architecture as a kind of

1037
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:15,519
default it's an encoder decoder

1038
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,440
architecture where you'll have a machine

1039
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:19,039
learning system that consumes color

1040
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:22,800
and then transfers that into a decoding

1041
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:25,039
phase where it tries to produce an

1042
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,480
utterance so here you've consumed a

1043
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:28,559
bunch of colors and produced the

1044
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:32,239
but of course you'll be able to explore

1045
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:34,318
many variants of this architecture and

1046
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,519
really explore different things that are

1047
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:39,199
representation and natural language

1048
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:42,239
and again as a bake off it will work the

1049
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:44,799
development on training data that we

1050
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,640
and then you'll be evaluated on the held

1051
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:50,000
out test set that was produced in the

1052
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,719
but involves entirely new colors and

1053
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,920
quick note on the original systems as i

1054
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,599
said before the original system is kind

1055
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,519
of a central piece of each one of the

1056
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,760
assignments the homeworks really

1057
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:08,000
culminate in this original system and

1058
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,000
that becomes your bake off entry

1059
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,599
um in terms of grading it this is kind

1060
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,440
of hard because we want you to be

1061
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:15,039
creative and try lots of things so the

1062
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,440
way we're going to value these entries

1063
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:19,199
is any system that performs extremely

1064
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,079
well on the bake off will be given full

1065
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,400
even symbols that have systems that are

1066
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:26,159
very simple right we can argue with

1067
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,639
success according to the criteria that

1068
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:30,318
we've set up so if the simplest possible

1069
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:32,318
approach to one of these bake offs turns

1070
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:34,719
out to be astoundingly good and you had

1071
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:36,480
to do almost no work to succeed you of

1072
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,318
but that's not the only thing we value

1073
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,880
right so systems that are creative and

1074
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:44,639
well motivated will be given full credit

1075
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,640
even if they don't perform well on the

1076
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:48,639
big off data this is meant to be an

1077
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:51,440
explicit encouragement for you to try

1078
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:53,440
new things to be bold and be creative

1079
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,358
even if it doesn't numerically lead to

1080
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,920
the best results in fact some of the

1081
00:42:55,358 --> 00:42:59,679
most inspiring things we've seen and

1082
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,680
insightful things we've seen as part of

1083
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:03,759
these bake-offs have been systems that

1084
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:05,598
didn't perform at the top of the heap

1085
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,400
but harbored some really interesting

1086
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,318
insight that we could build on

1087
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,480
right and then of course systems that

1088
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:14,079
really are minimal you do if you do very

1089
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,000
little and you don't do especially well

1090
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,720
at the bake off we'll receive less

1091
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,239
credit um the specific criteria will

1092
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:22,480
depend on the nature of the assignment

1093
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:24,959
and so forth we'll try to justify that

1094
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,679
for you this is the more subjective part

1095
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,679
i think one and two really encode the

1096
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:31,838
positive part of the kind of values that

1097
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:35,358
we're trying to convey to you as part of

1098
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:35,358
these original system entries

1099
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:40,078
and then you'll have project work this

1100
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,318
occupies the entire second half of the

1101
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:46,159
at that point the lectures the notebooks

1102
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,480
the readings and so forth are really

1103
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:50,000
focused on things like methods metrics

1104
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,480
error analysis model introspection and

1105
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,119
other things that will help you enrich

1106
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,640
the assignments are all project related

1107
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:02,318
um they're the literature view the

1108
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:04,480
experimental protocol and the final

1109
00:44:02,318 --> 00:44:06,239
paper unfortunately in many years we've

1110
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,318
had a video presentation which has

1111
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:10,078
always been really rewarding but i feel

1112
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:11,759
like given the compressed time schedule

1113
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,720
that we're on we just don't have time

1114
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:17,679
for even short videos we're going to

1115
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,838
focus on these three crucial components

1116
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:21,519
uh and if for exceptional final projects

1117
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:22,960
from past years that we've selected you

1118
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:24,960
could follow this link it's access

1119
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,400
restricted but if you're enrolled in the

1120
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,318
course you should be able to follow the

1121
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,079
link and see some of some examples and

1122
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:32,639
there's a lot more gardens on final

1123
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:35,839
projects in our course repository i have

1124
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:38,078
a very long write-up of faqs and other

1125
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:40,559
guidance about publishing in the field

1126
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,400
and writing for this class and i have

1127
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:44,799
what what is now a really inspiringly

1128
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,400
long list of published papers that have

1129
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,079
grown out of work people have done for

1130
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,160
this course so you can check that all

1131
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,480
out here final words here by way of

1132
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:54,639
wrapping up as i said this is the most

1133
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,920
most exciting moment ever in history for

1134
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,119
this course will give you hands-on

1135
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,960
experience with a wide range of

1136
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:02,480
challenging problems i emphasize the

1137
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,519
hands-on thing i think this is so

1138
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:06,159
if you want to acquire a new skill like

1139
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:09,679
it's all well and good to watch other

1140
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:12,159
people doing it but the way you really

1141
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:14,559
acquire the skill is by having hands-on

1142
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:16,480
experiences yourself so everything about

1143
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:18,239
the requirements and the materials is

1144
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,440
pushing you to have those hands-on

1145
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,159
and become expert at that very

1146
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:27,279
for the final project a mentor for the

1147
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,960
teaching team will guide you through

1148
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,639
we'll be there to help you and make

1149
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:34,239
choices and set the scope for the

1150
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:36,960
project and maybe push it towards

1151
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:38,879
something that you could one day publish

1152
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:42,000
there are many examples of successful

1153
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:44,079
publications deriving from this course

1154
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,159
our central goal fundamentally though is

go next into academia or just into other

1159
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:57,759
