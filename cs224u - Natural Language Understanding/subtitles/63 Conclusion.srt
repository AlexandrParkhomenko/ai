00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,535
Hello. We hope you found this course to be enjoyable and rewarding.

2
00:00:06,535 --> 00:00:07,870
Now that we're wrapping up,

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,090
your thoughts might be turning to how you can build on what

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,415
you've learned to conduct original research,

5
00:00:12,415 --> 00:00:13,930
to develop new technologies,

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:14,940
and so much more.

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,905
The material should position you really well to do this.

8
00:00:17,905 --> 00:00:20,800
The models for word representations that we discussed are

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,890
likely to be valuable components for any task you take on.

10
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,285
Our relation extraction unit focused on powerful techniques for distant supervision,

11
00:00:28,285 --> 00:00:31,330
which is a really common mode for applied problems.

12
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,310
And the natural language inference unit is

13
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,860
representative of the kind of opportunities and

14
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,840
challenges one faces when building deep learning systems with really large data sets.

15
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,640
And of course, the other lectures highlight

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,200
more diverse application areas and help reveal

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,110
how even complex cutting edge models are actually

18
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,230
usually made up of familiar modular components.

19
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,185
And of course, by now you've done a lot of work with our notebooks,

20
00:00:54,185 --> 00:00:57,680
you've designed three original systems and entered them into bake-offs,

21
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,570
and you've completed an original project.

22
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,345
This is an unusually high level of hands-on work,

23
00:01:02,345 --> 00:01:06,695
and the practical skills you've acquired should serve you well in many domains.

24
00:01:06,695 --> 00:01:09,590
The field of NLU continues to progress rapidly,

25
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,390
and you're now extremely well-positioned to

26
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,895
follow those changes and even help to shape them.

27
00:01:13,895 --> 00:01:16,130
For our part, we'll continue to update and improve

28
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,635
our NLU course materials, and share them widely.

29
00:01:18,635 --> 00:01:22,260
And we hope to see you in a future Stanford class soon.
