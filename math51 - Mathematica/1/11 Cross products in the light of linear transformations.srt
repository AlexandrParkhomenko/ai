1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:18,390
Hey folks! Where we left off,

2
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,750
I was talking about how to compute a three-dimensional
cross product

3
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,529
between two vectors, v x w.

4
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:29,430
It's this funny thing where you write a matrix,
whose second column has the coordinates of

5
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,430
v,

6
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,910
whose third column has the coordinates of
w,

7
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:39,010
but the entries of that first column, weirdly,
are the symbols i-hat, j-hat and k-hat

8
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:43,359
where you just pretend like those guys are
numbers for the sake of computations.

9
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,050
Then with that funky matrix in hand,

10
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,269
you compute its determinant.

11
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:51,989
If you just chug along with those computations,
ignoring the weirdness,

12
00:00:51,989 --> 00:01:00,239
you get some constant times i-hat + some constant
times j-hat + some constant times k-hat.

13
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,829
How specifically you think about computing
that determinant

14
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,890
is kind of beside the point.

15
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,130
All that really matters here is that you'll
end up with three different numbers

16
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,850
that are interpreted as the coordinates of
some resulting vector.

17
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,740
From here, students are typically told to
just believe that

18
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,909
the resulting vector has the following geometric
properties.

19
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,630
Its length equals the area of the parallelogram
defined by v and w.

20
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,170
It points in a direction perpendicular to
both of v and w.

21
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,740
And this direction obeys the right hand rule

22
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,770
in the sense that if you point your forefinger
along v

23
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,070
and your middle finger along w

24
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,630
then when you stick up your thumb

25
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:44,110
it'll point in the direction of the new vector.

26
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,780
There are some brute force computations

27
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,899
that you could do to confirm these facts.

28
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:51,259
But I want to share with you a really elegant
line of reasoning.

29
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:53,159
It leverages a bit of background, though.

30
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,500
So for this video I'm assuming that everybody
has watched chapter 5 on the determinant

31
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:04,770
and chapter 7 where I introduce the idea of
duality.

32
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,679
As a quick reminder, the idea of duality is
that

33
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:11,970
anytime you have a linear transformation from
some space to the number line,

34
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,290
it’s associated with a unique vector in
that space

35
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,209
in the sense that performing the linear transformation

36
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:21,900
is the same as taking a dot product with that
vector.

37
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,090
Numerically, this is because one of those
transformations

38
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,120
is described by a matrix with just one row

39
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:35,370
where each column tells you the number that
each basis vector lands on.

40
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,330
And multiplying this matrix by some vector
v is computationally identical to

41
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:46,580
taking the dot product between v and the vector
you get by turning that matrix on its side.

42
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,640
The takeaway is that whenever you're out in
the mathematical wild

43
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,590
and you find a linear transformation to the
number line

44
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,190
you will be able to match it to some vector

45
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,400
which is called the “dual vector” of that
transformation

46
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,830
so that performing the linear transformation

47
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:06,480
is the same as taking a dot product with that
vector.

48
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,610
The cross product gives us a really slick
example of this process in action.

49
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,690
It takes some effort, but it's definitely
worth it.

50
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,069
What I'm going to do is to define a certain
linear transformation from three dimensions

51
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:19,230
to the number line.

52
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,959
And it will be defined in terms of the two
vectors v and w.

53
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,629
Then, when we associate that transformation
with its “dual vector” in 3D space

54
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:33,299
that “dual vector” is going to be the
cross product of v and w.

55
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:37,030
The reason for doing this will be that understanding
that transformation

56
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:42,129
is going to make clear the connection between
the computation and the geometry of the cross

57
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:45,129
product.

58
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:46,500
So to back up a bit,

59
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,010
remember in two dimensions what it meant to
compute the 2D version of the cross product?

60
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,360
When you have two vectors v and w,

61
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,549
you put the coordinates of v as the first
column of the matrix

62
00:03:56,549 --> 00:03:59,709
and the coordinates of w is the second column
of matrix

63
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:01,870
then you just compute the determinant.

64
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,689
There's no nonsense with basis vectors stuck
in a matrix or anything like that.

65
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:08,950
Just an ordinary determinant returning a number.

66
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,829
Geometrically, this gives us the area of a
parallelogram

67
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:14,980
spanned out by those two vectors

68
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,300
with the possibility of being negative, depending
on the orientation of the vectors.

69
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,190
Now, if you didn't already know the 3D cross
product

70
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,820
and you're trying to extrapolate

71
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:29,539
you might imagine that it involves taking
three separate 3D vectors u, v and w.

72
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:35,090
And making their coordinates the columns of
a 3x3 matrix

73
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:38,130
then computing the determinant of that matrix.

74
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:41,280
And, as you know from chapter 5

75
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,490
geometrically, this would give you the volume
of a parallelepiped

76
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,669
spanned out by those three vectors

77
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:49,020
with the plus or minus sign

78
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,360
depending on the right-hand rule orientation
of those three vectors.

79
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,389
Of course, you all know that this is not the
3D cross product.

80
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:02,690
The actual 3D cross product takes in two vectors
and spits out a vector.

81
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,720
It doesn't take in three vectors and spit
out a number.

82
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,180
But this idea actually gets us really close
to what the real cross product is.

83
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,530
Consider that first vector u to be a variable

84
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,590
say, with variable entries x, y and z

85
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:23,280
while v and w remain fixed.

86
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,110
What we have then is a function from three
dimensions to the number line.

87
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,810
You input some vector x, y, z and you get
out a number

88
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,470
by taking the determinant of a matrix whose
first column is x, y, z

89
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:40,250
and whose other two columns are the coordinates
of the constant vectors v and w.

90
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,360
Geometrically, the meaning of this function
is that

91
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,650
for any input vector x, y, z, you consider
the parallelepiped defined by this vector

92
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,350
v and w

93
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:56,300
then you return its volume with the plus or
minus sign depending on orientations.

94
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,750
Now, this might feel like kind of a random
thing to do.

95
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,800
I mean, where does this function come from?

96
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,990
Why are we defining it this way?

97
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,140
And I'll admit at this stage of my kind of
feel like it's coming out of the blue.

98
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,490
But if you're willing to go along with it

99
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,020
and play around with the properties that this
guy has

100
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:15,770
it's the key to understanding the cross product.

101
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:19,889
One really important fact about this function
is that it's linear.

102
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:23,560
I'll actually leave it to you to work through
the details of why this is true

103
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,479
based on properties of the determinant.

104
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,949
But once you know that it's linear

105
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:35,310
we can start bringing in the idea of “duality”.

106
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,490
Once you know that it's linear

107
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,449
you know that there's some way to describe
this function as matrix multiplication.

108
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:46,050
Specifically, since it's a function that goes
from three dimensions to one dimension

109
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:51,389
there will be a 1x3 matrix that encodes this
transformation.

110
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:55,190
And the whole idea of duality

111
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:59,389
is that the special thing about transformations
from several dimensions to one dimension

112
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:01,639
is that you can turn that matrix on its side

113
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:08,759
and, instead, interpret the entire transformation
as the dot product with a certain vector.

114
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:12,910
What we're looking for is the special 3D vector
that I'll call p

115
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:17,710
such that taking the dot product between p
and any other vector [x, y, z]

116
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:23,310
gives the same result as plugging in [x, y,
z] as the first column of a 3x3 matrix

117
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,789
whose other two columns have the coordinates
of v and w

118
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:28,210
then computing the determinant.

119
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,360
I'll get to the geometry of this in just a
moment.

120
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,419
But right now, let's dig in and think about
what this means computationally.

121
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:39,500
Taking the dot product between p and [x, y,
z]

122
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,400
will give us something times x + something
times y + something times z

123
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,879
where those somethings are the coordinates
of p.

124
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:51,060
But on the right side here, when you compute
the determinant

125
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:57,060
you can organize it to look like some constant
times x + some constant times y + some constant

126
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,270
times z

127
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:03,789
where those constants involve certain combinations
of the components of v and w.

128
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:08,889
So, those constants, those particular combinations
of the coordinates of v and w

129
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:18,720
are going to be the coordinates of the vector
p that we're looking for.

130
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,199
But what's going on the right here

131
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,000
should feel very familiar to anyone

132
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,919
who's actually worked through a cross-product
computation.

133
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,440
Collecting the constant terms that are multiplied
by x, y and z like this

134
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:36,190
is no different from plugging in the symbols
i-hat, j-hat and k-hat to that first column

135
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:41,070
and seeing which coefficients aggregate on
each one of those terms.

136
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,900
It's just that plugging in i-hat, j-hat and
k-hat

137
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:48,840
is a way of signaling that we should interpret
those coefficients as the coordinates of a

138
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,190
vector.

139
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,710
So, what all of this is saying

140
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:58,200
is that this funky computation can be thought
of as a way to answer the following question:

141
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,840
What vector p has the special property

142
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,550
that when you take a dot product between p
and some vector [x, y, z]

143
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:10,450
it gives the same result as plugging in [x,
y, z] to the first column of the matrix

144
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,700
whose other two columns have the coordinates
of v and w

145
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,230
then computing the determinant?

146
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,510
That's a bit of a mouthful.

147
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,500
But it's an important question to digest for
this video.

148
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,690
Now for the cool part which ties all this
together

149
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:29,010
with the geometric understanding of the cross
product that I introduced last video.

150
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,090
I'm going to ask the same question again.

151
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,760
But this time, we're going to try to answer
it geometrically

152
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,820
instead of computationally.

153
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,840
What 3D vector p has the special property

154
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,850
that when you take a dot product between p
and some other vector [x, y, z]

155
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:50,250
it gives the same result as if you took the
signed volume of a parallelepiped

156
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:56,030
defined by this vector [x, y, z] along with
v and w?

157
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:00,660
Remember, the geometric interpretation of
a dot product

158
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,510
between a vector p and some other vector

159
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,750
is to project that other vector onto p

160
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:13,910
then to multiply the length of that projection
by the length of p.

161
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,410
With that in mind, let me show a certain way
to think about

162
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:20,520
the volume of the parallelepiped that we care
about.

163
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,950
Start by taking the area of the parallelogram
defined by v and w

164
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,310
then multiply it, not by the length of [x,
y, z]

165
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:34,510
but by the component of [x, y, z] that's perpendicular
to that parallelogram.

166
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:38,280
In other words, the way our linear function
works on a given vector

167
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,911
is to project that vector onto a line that's
perpendicular to both v and w

168
00:10:42,911 --> 00:10:49,130
then, to multiply the length of that projection
by the area of the parallelogram spanned by

169
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,860
v and w.

170
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,340
But this is the same thing as taking a dot
product

171
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:59,280
between [x, y, z] and a vector that's perpendicular
to v and w

172
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,380
with a length equal to the area of that parallelogram.

173
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,690
What's more, if you choose the appropriate
direction for that vector

174
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,080
the cases where the dot product is negative

175
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,520
will line up with the cases where the right
hand rule for the orientation of [x, y, z],

176
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:19,850
v and w is negative.

177
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,380
This means that we just found a vector p

178
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,860
so that taking a dot product between p and
some vector [x, y, z]

179
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,800
is the same thing as computing that determinant
of a 3x3 matrix

180
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,700
whose columns are [x, y, z], the coordinates
of v and w.

181
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,430
So, the answer that we found earlier, computationally

182
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,410
using that special notational trick

183
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:44,120
must correspond geometrically to this vector.

184
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,830
This is the fundamental reason

185
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:52,990
why the computation and the geometric interpretation
of the cross product are related.

186
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,490
Just to sum up what happened here

187
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:59,510
I started by defining a linear transformation
from 3D space to the number line

188
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:03,270
and it was defined in terms of the vectors
v and w

189
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,190
then I went through two separate ways

190
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,230
to think about the “dual vector” of this
transformation

191
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,890
the vector such that applying the transformation

192
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:14,920
is the same thing as taking a dot product
with that vector.

193
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,270
On the one hand, a computational approach

194
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,560
will lead you to the trick of plugging in
the symbols i-hat, j-hat and k-hat

195
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,450
to the first column of the matrix and computing
the determinant.

196
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,460
But, thinking geometrically

197
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,990
we can deduce that this duel vector must be
perpendicular to v and w

198
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:39,570
with a length equal to the area of the parallelogram
spanned out by those two vectors.

199
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:43,500
Since both of these approaches give us a dual
vector to the same transformation

200
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,560
they must be the same vector.

201
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,180
So that wraps up dot products and cross products.

202
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,670
And the next video will be a really important
concept for linear algebra

203
00:12:53,670 --> 00:13:09,200
“change of basis”
