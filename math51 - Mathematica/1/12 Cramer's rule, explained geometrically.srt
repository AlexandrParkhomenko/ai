2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,180
in a previous video I've talked about

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,370
linear systems of equations and I sort

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:16,900
of brushed aside the discussion of

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,610
actually computing solutions to these

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,650
systems and while it's true that the

7
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:21,970
number crunching is typically something

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,890
we leave to the computers digging into

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,750
some of these computational methods is a

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,369
good litmus test for whether or not you

11
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:28,990
actually understand what's going on

12
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,789
since that's really where the rubber

13
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:33,070
meets the road here I want to describe

14
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,080
the geometry behind a certain method for

15
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,030
computing solutions to these systems

16
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,150
known as Kramer's rule the relevant

17
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,800
background here is understanding

18
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,450
determinants a little bit of dot

19
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,489
products and of course linear systems of

20
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:47,050
equations so be sure to watch the

21
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,760
relevant videos on those topics if

22
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,579
you're unfamiliar or rusty but first I

23
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:53,350
should say up front that this Kramer's

24
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,510
rule is not actually the best way for

25
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,340
computing solutions to linear systems of

26
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,440
equations Gaussian elimination for

27
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,649
example will always be faster so why

28
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:04,690
learn it well think of it as a sort of

29
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,700
cultural excursion it's a helpful

30
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,410
exercise in deepening your knowledge of

31
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,259
the theory behind these systems wrapping

32
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:12,820
your mind around this concept is going

33
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,740
to help consolidate ideas from linear

34
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,810
algebra like the determinants and linear

35
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,970
systems by seeing how they relate to

36
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,520
each other also from a purely artistic

37
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,350
standpoint the ultimate result here is

38
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,270
just really pretty to think about way

39
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,410
more so than Gaussian elimination

40
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,540
alright so the setup here will be some

41
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,730
linear system of equations say with two

42
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,270
unknowns x and y and two equations in

43
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,830
principle everything we're talking about

44
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,660
will also work for systems with larger

45
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,370
number of unknowns and the same number

46
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,320
of equations but for simplicity a

47
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,119
smaller example is just nicer to hold in

48
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,400
our heads so as I talked about in a

49
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,350
previous video you can think of this set

50
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,690
up geometrically as a certain known

51
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:54,840
matrix transforming an unknown vector X

52
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,180
Y where you know what the output is

53
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,340
going to be in this case negative 4

54
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,080
negative 2

55
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,580
remember the columns of this matrix are

56
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,040
telling you how that matrix acts as a

57
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,530
transform each one telling you where the

58
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,889
basis vectors of the input space land so

59
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,290
what we have is a sort of puzzle which

60
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,530
input vector XY is going to land on this

61
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,190
output negative 4 negative 2 one way to

62
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,660
think about our little puzzle here is

63
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,940
that we know the given output vector is

64
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,220
some linear combination of the columns

65
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,770
of the matrix x times the vector where I

66
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,020
hat lands plus y times the vector where

67
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,030
J hat lands but what we want is to

68
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,769
figure out what exactly that linear

69
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:37,890
combination should be remember the type

70
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,660
of answer you get here can depend on

71
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,040
whether or not the transformation

72
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,110
squishes all of space into a lower

73
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,420
dimension that is if it has a 0

74
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,450
determinant in that case either none of

75
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,670
the inputs land on our given output or

76
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,920
there's a whole bunch of inputs landing

77
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,790
on that output

78
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,050
but for this video will limit our view

79
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,780
to the case of a nonzero determinant

80
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,860
meaning the outputs of this

81
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,350
transformation still span the full in

82
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,880
dimensional space that it started in

83
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,430
every input lands on one and only one

84
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,830
output and every output has one and only

85
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,360
one input

86
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,130
as a first pass let me show you an idea

87
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,840
that's wrong but in the right direction

88
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,570
the x-coordinate of this mystery input

89
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,700
vector is what you get by taking its dot

90
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,390
product with the first basis vector 1 0

91
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,980
likewise the y-coordinate is what you

92
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,990
get by dotting it with the second basis

93
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,320
vector 0 1 so maybe you hope that after

94
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,900
the transformation the dot products with

95
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,030
the transformed version of the mystery

96
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,100
vector with the transformed version of

97
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,140
the basis vectors will also be these

98
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,240
coordinates x and y that would be

99
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,870
fantastic

100
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,850
because we know what the transformed

101
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:50,380
version of each of those vectors are

102
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,280
there's just one problem with it it's

103
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,140
not at all true for most linear

104
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,910
transformations the dot product before

105
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,160
and after the transformation will look

106
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,560
very different for example you could

107
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,240
have two vectors generally pointing in

108
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,160
the same direction with a positive dot

109
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,470
product which get pulled apart from each

110
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,210
other during the transformation in such

111
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,740
a way that they end up having a negative

112
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,670
dot product

113
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,470
likewise things that start off

114
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,840
perpendicular with dot product zero like

115
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,120
the two basis vectors quite often don't

116
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,709
stay perpendicular to each other after

117
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,779
the transformation that is they don't

118
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,610
preserve that zero dot product and

119
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,860
looking at the example I just showed dot

120
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,510
products certainly aren't preserved they

121
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,350
tend to get bigger

122
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,880
since most vectors are getting stretched

123
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,600
out in fact worthwhile side note here

124
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,860
transformations which do preserve dot

125
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,600
products are special enough to have

126
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,340
their own name or the normal

127
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,350
transformations these are the ones that

128
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,520
leave all of the basis vectors

129
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,680
perpendicular to each other and still

130
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,290
with unit lengths you often think of

131
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,480
these as the rotation matrices they

132
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,400
correspond to rigid motion with no

133
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,250
stretching or squishing or morphing

134
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,240
solving a linear system with an

135
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,400
orthonormal matrix is actually super

136
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,800
easy because dot products are preserved

137
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,990
taking the dot product between the

138
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,000
output vector and all the columns of

139
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,040
your matrix will be the same as taking

140
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,840
the dot product between the mystery

141
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,820
input vector and all of the basis

142
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,560
vectors which is the same as just

143
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,540
finding the coordinates of that mystery

144
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,900
input so in that very special case X

145
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,880
would be the dot product of the first

146
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,310
column with the output vector and Y

147
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,320
would be the dot product of the second

148
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,730
column with the output vector

149
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,530
why am i bringing this up when this idea

150
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,330
breaks down for almost all linear

151
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,610
systems well it points us in a direction

152
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,770
of something to look for is there an

153
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,110
alternate geometric understanding for

154
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,240
the coordinates of our input vector that

155
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,009
remains unchanged after the

156
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:43,289
transformation if your mind has been

157
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:45,210
mulling over determinants you might

158
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,889
think of the following clever idea

159
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:49,590
take the parallelogram defined by the

160
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,259
first basis vector I hat and the mystery

161
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:55,680
input vector XY the area of this

162
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,530
parallelogram is the base one times the

163
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,599
height perpendicular to that base which

164
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:02,909
is the y coordinate of that input vector

165
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:06,030
so the area of that parallelogram is a

166
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,069
sort of screwy roundabout way to

167
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:10,650
describe the vectors y coordinate it's a

168
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,210
wacky way to talk about coordinates but

169
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,880
run with me and actually to be a little

170
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,259
more accurate you should think of this

171
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,870
as the signed area of that parallelogram

172
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,789
in the sense described in the

173
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:23,490
determinant video that way a vector with

174
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,949
a negative y coordinate would correspond

175
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:27,720
to a negative area for this

176
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,880
parallelogram at least if you think of I

177
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,070
hat as in some sense being the first out

178
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,539
of these two vectors defining the

179
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:36,300
parallelogram and symmetrically if you

180
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,070
look at the parallelogram spanned by our

181
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,110
mystery input vector and the second

182
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,169
basis J hat it's area is going to be the

183
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,180
x coordinate of that mystery vector

184
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,310
again it's a strange way to represent

185
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,229
the x coordinate but you'll see what it

186
00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:51,180
buys us in a moment and just to make

187
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,110
sure it's clear how this might

188
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,250
generalize let's look in three

189
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,530
dimensions ordinarily the way you might

190
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,090
think about one of a vectors coordinates

191
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,550
say it's Z coordinate would be to take

192
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,710
its dot product with the third standard

193
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,620
basis vector often called K hat but an

194
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,719
alternate geometric interpretation would

195
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:09,150
be to consider the parallelepiped that

196
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,219
it creates with the other two basis

197
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:14,009
vectors I hat and J hat if you think of

198
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:16,500
these square with area one spanned by I

199
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,960
hat and J hat is the base of this whole

200
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,360
shape then its volume is the same as its

201
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,039
height which is the third coordinate of

202
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,340
our vector

203
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,050
and likewise the wacky way to think

204
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,160
about the other coordinates of the

205
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,020
vector would be to form a parallelepiped

206
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,180
using the vector and then all of the

207
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,400
basis vectors other than the one

208
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,840
corresponding to the direction you're

209
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,850
looking for then the volume of this

210
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,040
gives you the coordinate or rather we

211
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,120
should be talking about the signed

212
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,490
volume of parallelepipeds in the sense

213
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,870
described in the determinants video

214
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,300
using the right hand rule so the order

215
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,620
in which you list these three vectors

216
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,080
matters that way negative coordinates

217
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,229
still make sense okay so why think of

218
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:54,880
coordinates as areas and volumes like

219
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,100
this well as you apply some sort of

220
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,010
matrix transformation the areas of these

221
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:00,910
parallelograms

222
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,710
well they don't stay the same they might

223
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,050
get scaled up or down but and this is

224
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,330
the key idea of determinants all of the

225
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,760
areas get scaled by the same amount

226
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,500
namely the determinant of our

227
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,470
transformation matrix for example if you

228
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,030
look at the parallelogram spanned by the

229
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,919
vector where your first basis vector

230
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,350
lands which is the first column of the

231
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,840
matrix and the transformed version of X

232
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,500
Y what is its area well this is the

233
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,419
transformed version of the parallelogram

234
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:30,370
we were looking at earlier the one whose

235
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,529
area was the y coordinate of the mystery

236
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:35,140
input vector so it's area is just going

237
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,370
to be the determinant of the

238
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,500
transformation multiplied by that

239
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,349
y-coordinate so that means we can solve

240
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:44,410
for y by taking the area of this new

241
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,140
parallelogram in the output space

242
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,089
divided by the determinant of the full

243
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:51,070
transformation

244
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,890
how do you get that area well we know

245
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,540
the coordinates for where the mystery

246
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,400
input vector lands that's the whole

247
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,800
point of a linear system of equations so

248
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,810
what you might do is create a new matrix

249
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,360
whose first column is the same as that

250
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,730
of our matrix but whose second column is

251
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,640
the output vector and then you take its

252
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,120
determinant so look at that just using

253
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,500
data from the output of the

254
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,810
transformation namely the columns of the

255
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,400
matrix and the coordinates of our output

256
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,070
vector we can recover the y coordinate

257
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,170
of the mystery input vector which is

258
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,360
halfway to solving the system likewise

259
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,010
the same idea can give us the x

260
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,260
coordinate look at the parallelogram we

261
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,450
defined earlier which encodes the x

262
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,280
coordinate of the mystery input vector

263
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,400
spanned by that vector and j-hat the

264
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,740
transformed version of this guy is

265
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,900
spanned by the output vector and the

266
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,990
second column of the matrix and its area

267
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,370
will have been multiplied by the

268
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,370
determinant of that matrix so to solve

269
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,980
for x you can take this new area divided

270
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,270
by the determinant of the full

271
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,580
transformation and similar to what we

272
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,440
did before you can compute the area of

273
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,080
that output parallelogram by creating a

274
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,300
new matrix whose first column is the

275
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,820
output vector and whose second column is

276
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,550
the same as the original matrix so again

277
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,320
just using data from the output space

278
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,150
the numbers we see in our original

279
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,190
linear system we can solve for what X

280
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,680
must be this formula for finding the

281
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,120
solutions to a linear system of

282
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,210
equations is known as Kramer's rule here

283
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,130
just a sanity check ourselves plug in

284
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,990
some numbers here the determinant of

285
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,780
that top altered matrix is 4 plus 2

286
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,540
which is 6 and the bottom determinant is

287
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,940
2 so the x-coordinate should be 3 and

288
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,250
indeed looking back at the input vector

289
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,610
we started with the x-coordinate is 3

290
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,080
likewise Kramer's rule suggests that the

291
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,930
y-coordinate should be 4 divided by 2 or

292
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:44,380
2 and that is in fact the y-coordinate

293
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,760
of the input vector that we were

294
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,640
starting with the case with 3 dimensions

295
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,650
or more is similar and I highly

296
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,970
recommend that you take a moment to

297
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,310
pause and think through it yourself here

298
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,800
I'll give you a little bit of momentum

299
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,660
what we have is a known transformation

300
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,360
given by some 3x3 matrix and a known

301
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,850
output vector given by the right side of

302
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,730
our linear system

303
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,580
and we want to know what input lands on

304
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,340
that output and if you think of say the

305
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,710
Z coordinate of that input vector as the

306
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,350
volume of that special parallelepiped we

307
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,540
were looking at earlier spanned by I hat

308
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,870
J hat and the mystery input vector what

309
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,120
happens to that volume after the

310
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,730
transformation and what are the various

311
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,400
ways that you can compute that volume

312
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,110
really pause and take a moment to think

313
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,760
through the details of generalizing this

314
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,500
to higher dimensions finding an

315
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,330
expression for each coordinate of the

316
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,370
solution to a larger linear system

317
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,590
thinking through more general cases like

318
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,450
this and convincing yourself that it

319
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,700
works and why it works is where all of

320
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,680
the learning really happens much more so

321
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,940
than listening to some dude on YouTube

322
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,500
walk you through the same reasoning

323
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,650
again

324
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:54,709
