1
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,960
if i have a vector sitting here in 2d

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,960
space we have a standard way to describe

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,039
it with coordinates in this case the

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,439
vector has coordinates 3 2 which means

5
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,840
going from its tail to its tip involves

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,480
moving 3 units to the right and 2 units

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,439
up

8
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,679
now the more linear algebra-oriented way

9
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,679
to describe coordinates is to think of

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,160
each of these numbers as a scalar a

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,800
thing that stretches or squishes vectors

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,640
you think of that first coordinate as

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,280
scaling i-hat the vector with length 1

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,600
pointing to the right

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,559
while the second coordinate scales j hat

16
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,160
the vector with length one pointing

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,520
straight up

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,840
the tip to tail sum of those two scaled

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,760
vectors is what the coordinates are

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,920
meant to describe

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,280
you can think of these two special

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,520
vectors as encapsulating all of the

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,440
implicit assumptions of our coordinate

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,640
system

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,400
the fact that the first number indicates

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,080
rightward motion that the second one

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,479
indicates upward motion exactly how far

28
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,720
a unit of distance is all of that is

29
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,439
tied up in the choice of i-hat and j-hat

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,880
as the vectors which are scalar

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,759
coordinates are meant to actually scale

32
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,840
any way to translate between vectors and

33
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,000
sets of numbers is called a coordinate

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,799
system and the two special vectors i-hat

35
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,439
and j hat are called the basis vectors

36
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,000
of our standard coordinate system

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,840
what i'd like to talk about here is the

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,159
idea of using a different set of basis

39
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,759
vectors

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,759
for example let's say you have a friend

41
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,000
jennifer who uses a different set of

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,920
basis vectors which i'll call b1 and b2

43
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,479
her first basis vector b1 points up and

44
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,479
to the right a little bit and her second

45
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,000
vector b2 points left and up

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,600
now take another look at that vector

47
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,520
that i showed earlier the one that you

48
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,720
and i would describe using the

49
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,119
coordinates 3 2 using our basis vectors

50
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,280
i-hat and j-hat

51
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,880
jennifer would actually describe this

52
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,040
vector with the coordinates five-thirds

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,640
and one-third

54
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,878
what this means is that the particular

55
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,520
way to get to that vector using her two

56
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,879
basis vectors is to scale b1 by five

57
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,920
thirds

58
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,360
scale b2 by one-third then add them both

59
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,720
together

60
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,000
in a little bit i'll show you how you

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,680
could have figured out those two numbers

62
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,840
five thirds and one-third

63
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
in general whenever jennifer uses

64
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,760
coordinates to describe a vector she

65
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,200
thinks of her first coordinate as

66
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,360
scaling b1 the second coordinate is

67
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,680
scaling b2 and she adds the results

68
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,040
what she gets will typically be

69
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,480
completely different from the vector

70
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,080
that you and i would think of as having

71
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,879
those coordinates

72
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,319
to be a little more precise about the

73
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,360
setup here her first basis vector b1 is

74
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,959
something that we would describe with

75
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,760
the coordinates 2 1 and her second basis

76
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,080
vector b2 is something that we would

77
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,280
describe as negative 1 1. but it's

78
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,800
important to realize from her

79
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,519
perspective in her system those vectors

80
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,159
have coordinates 1 0 and 0 1

81
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,400
they are what define the meaning of the

82
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,640
coordinates 1 0 and 0 1 in her world

83
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,720
so in effect we're speaking different

84
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,840
languages

85
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,519
we're all looking at the same vectors in

86
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,080
space but jennifer uses different words

87
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,360
and numbers to describe them

88
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,879
let me say a quick word about how i'm

89
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,040
representing things here when i animate

90
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,360
2d space i typically use this square

91
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,080
grid but that grid is just a construct a

92
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,239
way to visualize our coordinate system

93
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,920
and so it depends on our choice of basis

94
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,680
space itself has no intrinsic grid

95
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,680
jennifer might draw her own grid which

96
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,440
would be an equally made-up construct

97
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,440
meant as nothing more than a visual tool

98
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,799
to help follow the meaning of her

99
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,360
coordinates

100
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,959
her origin though would actually line up

101
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,280
with ours since everybody agrees on what

102
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,599
the coordinates 0 0 should mean

103
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,040
it's the thing that you get when you

104
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,439
scale any vector by zero

105
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,439
but the direction of her axes and the

106
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,120
spacing of her grid lines will be

107
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,879
different depending on her choice of

108
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,360
basis vectors

109
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,360
so after all this is set up a pretty

110
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,280
natural question to ask is how we

111
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,320
translate between coordinate systems

112
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,320
if for example jennifer describes a

113
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,600
vector with coordinates negative 1 2

114
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,440
what would that be in our coordinate

115
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,360
system how do you translate from her

116
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,360
language to hours

117
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,520
well what her coordinates are saying is

118
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,639
that this vector is negative 1 times b 1

119
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,240
plus 2 times b 2.

120
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,680
and from our perspective b1 has

121
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,600
coordinates 2 1

122
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,560
and b2 has coordinates negative 1 1.

123
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,680
so we can actually compute negative 1

124
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,199
times b1 plus 2 times b2 as they're

125
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,680
represented in our coordinate system and

126
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,440
working this out you get a vector with

127
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,280
coordinates negative 4 1.

128
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,199
so that's how we would describe the

129
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,199
vector that she thinks of as negative 1

130
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,560
2.

131
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,720
this process here of scaling each of her

132
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,639
basis vectors by the corresponding

133
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,800
coordinates of some vector then adding

134
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,960
them together might feel somewhat

135
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,240
familiar

136
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,720
it's matrix vector multiplication with a

137
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,639
matrix whose columns represent

138
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,520
jennifer's basis vectors in our language

139
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,600
in fact once you understand matrix

140
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
vector multiplication as applying a

141
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,759
certain linear transformation say by

142
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,120
watching what i view to be the most

143
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,840
important video in this series chapter 3

144
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,440
there's a pretty intuitive way to think

145
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,520
about what's going on here

146
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,360
a matrix whose columns represent

147
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,440
jennifer's basis vectors can be thought

148
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,919
of as a transformation that moves our

149
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,639
basis vectors i-hat and j-hat the things

150
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,680
we think of when we say 1 0 and 0-1 to

151
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,240
jennifer's basis vectors the things she

152
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,800
thinks of when she says 1 0 and 0 1.

153
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,320
to show how this works let's walk

154
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,919
through what it would mean to take the

155
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,600
vector that we think of as having

156
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,080
coordinates negative 1 2 and applying

157
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,000
that transformation

158
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,680
before the linear transformation we're

159
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,280
thinking of this vector as a certain

160
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,919
linear combination of our basis vectors

161
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,400
negative 1 times i hat plus 2 times j

162
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,199
hat

163
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,960
and the key feature of a linear

164
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,280
transformation is that the resulting

165
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,360
vector will be that same linear

166
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,080
combination but of the new basis vectors

167
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,240
negative one times the place where i hat

168
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,720
lands plus two times the place where j

169
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,280
hat lands

170
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,319
so what this matrix does is transform

171
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,960
our misconception of what jennifer means

172
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,720
into the actual vector that she's

173
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,440
referring to

174
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,280
i remember that when i was first

175
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,720
learning this it always felt kind of

176
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,960
backwards to me geometrically this

177
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,120
matrix transforms our grid into

178
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,600
jennifer's grid but numerically it's

179
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,520
translating a vector described in her

180
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,280
language to our language

181
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,560
what made it finally click for me was

182
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,919
thinking about how it takes our

183
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,160
misconception of what jennifer means the

184
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,240
vector we get using the same coordinates

185
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,880
but in our system then it transforms it

186
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,479
into the vector that she really meant

187
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,919
what about going the other way around

188
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,080
in the example i used earlier this video

189
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,840
when i had the vector with coordinates 3

190
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,400
2 in our system how did i compute that

191
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,280
it would have coordinates 5 3 and 1 3 in

192
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,840
jennifer's system

193
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,599
you start with that change of basis

194
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,440
matrix that translates jennifer's

195
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,759
language into hours then you take its

196
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,160
inverse

197
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,599
remember the inverse of a transformation

198
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,000
is a new transformation that corresponds

199
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,560
to playing that first one backwards in

200
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,240
practice especially when you're working

201
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,080
in more than two dimensions you'd use a

202
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,599
computer to compute the matrix that

203
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,080
actually represents this inverse

204
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,319
in this case the inverse of the change

205
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,080
of basis matrix that has jennifer's

206
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,639
basis as its columns ends up working out

207
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,720
to have columns one-third negative

208
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,199
one-third and one-third two-thirds

209
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,840
so for example to see what the vector 3

210
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,479
2 looks like in jennifer's system we

211
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,639
multiply this inverse change of basis

212
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,000
matrix by the vector 3 2 which works out

213
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,360
to be 5 3 1 3.

214
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,759
so that in a nutshell is how to

215
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,919
translate the description of individual

216
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,599
vectors back and forth between

217
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,120
coordinate systems

218
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,039
the matrix whose columns represent

219
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,120
jennifer's basis vectors but written in

220
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,399
our coordinates

221
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,479
translates vectors from her language

222
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,519
into our language

223
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,640
and the inverse matrix does the opposite

224
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,640
but vectors aren't the only thing that

225
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,360
we describe using coordinates

226
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,959
for this next part it's important that

227
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,480
you're all comfortable representing

228
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,800
transformations with matrices and that

229
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,880
you know how matrix multiplication

230
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,800
corresponds to composing successive

231
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,240
transformations

232
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,839
definitely pause and take a look at

233
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,240
chapters 3 and 4 if any of that feels

234
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,720
uneasy

235
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,959
consider some linear transformation like

236
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,839
a 90 degree counterclockwise rotation

237
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,519
when you and i represent this with a

238
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,399
matrix we follow where the basis vectors

239
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,279
i-hat and j-hat each go

240
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,880
i-hat ends up at the spot with

241
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,680
coordinates 0 1 and j-hat ends up at the

242
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,320
spot with coordinates negative 1 0

243
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,560
so those coordinates become the columns

244
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,760
of our matrix but this representation is

245
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,920
heavily tied up in our choice of basis

246
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,440
vectors from the fact that we're

247
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,360
following i-hat and j-hat in the first

248
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,360
place to the fact that we're recording

249
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,279
their landing spots in our own

250
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,080
coordinate system

251
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,880
how would jennifer describe this same 90

252
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,240
degree rotation of space

253
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
you might be tempted to just translate

254
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,640
the columns of our rotation matrix into

255
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,800
jennifer's language but that's not quite

256
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,120
right those columns represent where our

257
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,920
basis vectors i-hat and j-hat go but the

258
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,680
matrix that jennifer wants should

259
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,079
represent where her basis vectors land

260
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,839
and it needs to describe those landing

261
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,560
spots in a her language

262
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,240
here's a common way to think of how this

263
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,360
is done

264
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,120
start with any vector written in

265
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,880
jennifer's language

266
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,240
rather than trying to follow what

267
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,560
happens to it in terms of her language

268
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,320
first we're going to translate it into

269
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,560
our language using the change of basis

270
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,120
matrix the one whose columns represent

271
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,760
her basis vectors in our language this

272
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,760
gives us the same vector but now written

273
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,680
in our language

274
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,079
then apply the transformation matrix to

275
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,000
what you get by multiplying it on the

276
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,040
left

277
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,120
this tells us where that vector lands

278
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,360
but still in our language

279
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,680
so as a last step apply the inverse

280
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,760
change of basis matrix multiplied on the

281
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,320
left as usual to get the transformed

282
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,160
vector but now in jennifer's language

283
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,000
since we could do this with any vector

284
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,920
written in her language first applying

285
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,680
the change of basis then the

286
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,000
transformation then the inverse change

287
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,120
of basis

288
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,920
that composition of three matrices

289
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,079
gives us the transformation matrix in

290
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,760
jennifer's language

291
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,079
it takes in a vector of her language and

292
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,680
spits out the transformed version of

293
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,160
that vector in her language

294
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,839
for this specific example when

295
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,160
jennifer's basis vectors look like 2 1

296
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,640
and negative 1 1 in our language and

297
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,480
when the transformation is a 90 degree

298
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,600
rotation

299
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,760
the product of these three matrices if

300
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,279
you work through it has columns 1 3 5 3

301
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,120
and negative two-thirds negative

302
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,480
one-third

303
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,120
so if jennifer multiplies that matrix by

304
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,800
the coordinates of a vector in her

305
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,839
system

306
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,160
it will return the 90-degree rotated

307
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,480
version of that vector expressed in her

308
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,839
coordinate system

309
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,480
in general whenever you see an

310
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,279
expression like a inverse times m times

311
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,079
a it suggests a mathematical sort of

312
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,720
empathy that middle matrix represents a

313
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,800
transformation of some kind as you see

314
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,440
it and the outer two matrices represent

315
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,480
the empathy the shift in perspective

316
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,800
and the full matrix product represents

317
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,959
that same transformation but as someone

318
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,480
else sees it

319
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,320
for those of you wondering why we care

320
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,160
about alternate coordinate systems the

321
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,920
next video on eigenvectors and

322
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,079
eigenvalues will give a really important

323
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,600
example of this see you then

324
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,240
you
