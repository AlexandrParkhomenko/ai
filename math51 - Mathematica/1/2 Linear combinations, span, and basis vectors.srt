1
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,910
In the last video, along with the ideas of
vector addition and scalar multiplication,

2
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,770
I described vector coordinates,

3
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:23,240
where's this back and forth between, for example,
pairs of numbers and two-dimensional vectors.

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,500
Now, I imagine that vector coordinates were
already familiar to a lot of you,

5
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,520
but there's another kind of interesting way
to think about these coordinates,

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,950
which is pretty central to linear algebra.

7
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:37,080
When you have a pair of numbers that's meant
to describe a vector, like [3, -2],

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,770
I want you to think about each coordinate
as a scalar,

9
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,690
meaning, think about how each one stretches
or squishes vectors,

10
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,979
In the xy-coordinate system, there are two
very special vectors:

11
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:53,730
the one pointing to the right with length
1, commonly called "i-hat", or the unit vector

12
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,299
in the x-direction,

13
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:59,280
and the one pointing straight up, with length
1, commonly called "j-hat",

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,820
or the unit vector in the y-direction.

15
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:07,350
Now, think of the x-coordinate of our vector
as a scalar that scales i-hat, stretching

16
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,080
it by a factor of 3,

17
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,390
and the y-coordinate as a scalar that scales
j-hat, flipping it and stretching it by a

18
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:14,970
factor of 2.

19
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:21,140
In this sense, the vectors that these coordinates
describe is the sum of two scaled vectors.

20
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:27,460
That's a surprisingly important concept, this
idea of adding together two scaled vectors.

21
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,840
Those two vectors, i-hat and j-hat, have a
special name, by the way.

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,170
Together, they're called the basis of a coordinate
system

23
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,170
What this means, basically, is that when you
think about coordinates as scalars,

24
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,499
the basis vectors are what those scalars actually,
you know, scale.

25
00:01:42,499 --> 00:01:47,640
There's also a more technical definition,
but I'll get to that later.

26
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,810
By framing our coordinate system in terms
of these two special basis vectors,

27
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,480
it raises a pretty interesting, and subtle,
point:

28
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:00,060
We could've chosen different basis vectors,
and gotten a completely reasonable, new coordinate

29
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,140
system.

30
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,570
For example, take some vector pointing up
and to the right, along with

31
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,150
some other vector pointing down and to the
right, in some way.

32
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:13,030
Take a moment to think about all the different
vectors that you can get by choosing two scalars,

33
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,010
using each one to scale one of the vectors,
then adding together what you get.

34
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:24,770
Which two-dimensional vectors can you reach
by altering the choices of scalars?

35
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,620
The answer is that you can reach every possible
two-dimensional vector,

36
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,380
and I think it's a good puzzle to contemplate
why.

37
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:36,690
A new pair of basis vectors like this still
gives us a valid way to go back and forth

38
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,690
between

39
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,970
pairs of numbers and two-dimensional vectors,

40
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,910
but the association is definitely different
from the one that you get

41
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,690
using the more standard basis of i-hat and
j-hat.

42
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,670
This is something I'll go into much more detail
on later, describing the exact relationship

43
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,670
between

44
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,200
different coordinate systems, but for right
now, I just want you to appreciate the fact

45
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
that

46
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,450
any time we describe vectors numerically,
it depends on an implicit choice of what basis

47
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,410
vectors we're using.

48
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,870
So any time that you're scaling two vectors
and adding them like this,

49
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:09,400
it's called a linear combination of those
two vectors.

50
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,870
Where does this word "linear" come from?

51
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,530
Why does this have anything to do with lines?

52
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,260
Well, this isn't the etymology, but one way
I like to think about it is that

53
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,459
if you fix one of those scalars, and let the
other one change its value freely,

54
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:27,370
the tip of the resulting vector draws a straight
line.

55
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:33,450
Now, if you let both scalars range freely,
and consider every possible vector that you

56
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,450
can get,

57
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,510
there are two things that can happen:

58
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,510
For most pairs of vectors, you'll be able
to reach every possible point in the plane;

59
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,319
every two-dimensional vector is within your
grasp.

60
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:47,540
However, in the unlucky case where your two
original vectors happen to line up,

61
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,900
the tip of the resulting vector is limited
to just this single line passing through the

62
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,250
origin.

63
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,440
Actually, technically there's a third possibility
too:

64
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,380
both your vectors could be zero, in which
case you'd just be stuck at the origin.

65
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,980
Here's some more terminology:

66
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,209
The set of all possible vectors that you can
reach with a linear combination of a given

67
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:08,410
pair of vectors

68
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,680
is called the span of those two vectors.

69
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,050
So, restating what we just saw in this lingo,

70
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:21,289
the span of most pairs of 2-D vectors is all
vectors of 2-D space,

71
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:27,190
but when they line up, their span is all vectors
whose tip sits on a certain line.

72
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:31,759
Remember how I said that linear algebra revolves
around vector addition and scalar multiplication?

73
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,490
Well, the span of two vectors is basically
a way of asking,

74
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:41,009
"What are all the possible vectors you can
reach using only these two fundamental operations,

75
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:43,669
vector addition and scalar multiplication?"

76
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:47,949
This is a good time to talk about how people
commonly think about vectors as points.

77
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:52,340
It gets really crowded to think about a whole
collection of vectors sitting on a line,

78
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,900
and more crowded still to think about all
two-dimensional vectors all at once, filling

79
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,169
up the plane.

80
00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:00,080
So when dealing with collections of vectors
like this,

81
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,840
it's common to represent each one with just
a point in space.

82
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,080
The point at the tip of that vector, where,
as usual, I want you thinking about that vector

83
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,749
with its tail on the origin.

84
00:05:10,749 --> 00:05:14,869
That way, if you want to think about every
possible vector whose tip sits on a certain

85
00:05:14,869 --> 00:05:15,869
line,

86
00:05:15,869 --> 00:05:18,880
just think about the line itself.

87
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,270
Likewise, to think about all possible two-dimensional
vectors all at once,

88
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,500
conceptualize each one as the point where
its tip sits.

89
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,930
So, in effect, what you'll be thinking about
is the infinite, flat sheet of two-dimensional

90
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,090
space itself,

91
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,199
leaving the arrows out of it.

92
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:40,539
In general, if you're thinking about a vector
on its own, think of it as an arrow,

93
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:43,619
and if you're dealing with a collection of
vectors, it's convenient to think of them

94
00:05:43,619 --> 00:05:44,960
all as points.

95
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,389
So, for our span example, the span of most
pairs of vectors ends up being

96
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:52,370
the entire infinite sheet of two-dimensional
space,

97
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:58,659
but if they line up, their span is just a
line.

98
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:03,009
The idea of span gets a lot more interesting
if we start thinking about vectors in three-dimensional

99
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:04,059
space.

100
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:09,419
For example, if you take two vectors, in 3-D
space, that are not pointing in the same direction,

101
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:12,099
what does it mean to take their span?

102
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:18,280
Well, their span is the collection of all
possible linear combinations of those two

103
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,490
vectors, meaning

104
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:24,479
all possible vectors you get by scaling each
of the two of them in some way, and then adding

105
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,029
them together.

106
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:30,629
You can kind of imagine turning two different
knobs to change the two scalars defining the

107
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:32,139
linear combination,

108
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:36,159
adding the scaled vectors and following the
tip of the resulting vector.

109
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:40,759
That tip will trace out some kind of flat
sheet, cutting through the origin of three-dimensional

110
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:42,039
space.

111
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:45,210
This flat sheet is the span of the two vectors,

112
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,779
or more precisely, the set of all possible
vectors whose tips sit on that flat sheet

113
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:52,039
is the span of your two vectors.

114
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:54,849
Isn't that a beautiful mental image?

115
00:06:54,849 --> 00:07:00,680
So what happens if we add a third vector and
consider the span of all three of those guys?

116
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,419
A linear combination of three vectors is defined
pretty much the same way as it is for two;

117
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:09,900
you'll choose three different scalars, scale
each of those vectors, and then add them all

118
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,309
together.

119
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:24,689
And again, the span of these vectors is the
set of all possible linear combinations.

120
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:26,469
Two different things could happen here:

121
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:30,169
If your third vector happens to be sitting
on the span of the first two,

122
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:34,559
then the span doesn't change; you're sort
of trapped on that same flat sheet.

123
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:38,729
In other words, adding a scaled version of
that third vector to the linear combination

124
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:42,889
doesn't really give you access to any new
vectors.

125
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:47,199
But if you just randomly choose a third vector,
it's almost certainly not sitting on the span

126
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,580
of those first two.

127
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,250
Then, since it's pointing in a separate direction,

128
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,610
it unlocks access to every possible three-dimensional
vector.

129
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,749
One way I like to think about this is that
as you scale that new third vector,

130
00:07:59,749 --> 00:08:06,120
it moves around that span sheet of the first
two, sweeping it through all of space.

131
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,819
Another way to think about it is that you're
making full use of the three, freely-changing

132
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:10,819
scalars that

133
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:15,639
you have at your disposal to access the full
three dimensions of space.

134
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:21,459
Now, in the case where the third vector was
already sitting on the span of the first two,

135
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,639
or the case where two vectors happen to line
up,

136
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,819
we want some terminology to describe the fact
that

137
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:27,169
at least one of these vectors

138
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:30,930
is redundant—not adding anything to our
span.

139
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,820
Whenever this happens, where you have multiple
vectors and you could remove one without reducing

140
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,820
the span,

141
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,490
the relevant terminology is to say that they
are

142
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,630
"linearly dependent".

143
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:44,340
Another way of phrasing that would be to say
that one of the vectors can be expressed as

144
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:53,030
a linear combination of the others since it's
already in the span of the others.

145
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:57,500
On the other hand, if each vector really does
add another dimension to the span,

146
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:06,450
they're said to be "linearly independent".

147
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:10,580
So with all of that terminology, and hopefully
with some good mental images to go with it,

148
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,890
let me leave you with puzzle before we go.

149
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:18,850
The technical definition of a basis of a space
is a set of linearly independent vectors that

150
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,120
span that space.

151
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,910
Now, given how I described a basis earlier,

152
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:29,180
and given your current understanding of the
words "span" and "linearly independent",

153
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:34,140
think about why this definition would make
sense.

154
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:42,180
In the next video, I'll get into matrices
and transforming space.

155
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:57,880
See you then!
