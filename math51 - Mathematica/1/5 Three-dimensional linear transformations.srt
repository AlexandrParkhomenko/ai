"Lisa: Well, where's my dad?

Frink: Well, it should be obvious to even the most dimwitted individual who holds an advanced degree in hyperbolic topology that Homer Simpson has stumbled into

00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,860
the third dimension."

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,460
Hey folks I've got a relatively quick
video for you today,

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,960
just sort of a footnote between chapters.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,400
In the last two videos I talked about

9
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,160
linear transformations and matrices, but,
I only showed the specific case of

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,250
transformations that take
two-dimensional vectors to other

11
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,950
two-dimensional vectors.

12
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,950
In general throughout the series we'll work
mainly

13
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,250
in two dimensions.

14
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,160
Mostly because it's easier to actually
see on the screen and wrap your mind around,

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,620
but, more importantly than that

16
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,230
once you get all the core ideas in two
dimensions they carry over pretty

17
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,610
seamlessly to higher dimensions.

18
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,990
Nevertheless it's good to peak our heads
outside of flatland now and then to...

19
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:52,181
you know see what it means to apply these
ideas in more than just those two dimensions.

20
00:00:52,181 --> 00:00:56,761
For example, consider a linear transformation with three-dimensional vectors as inputs

21
00:00:56,761 --> 00:00:59,999
and three-dimensional vectors as outputs.

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,120
We can visualize this by smooshing around
all the points in three-dimensional space,

23
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,300
as represented by a grid, in such a
way that keeps the grid lines parallel

24
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,240
and evenly spaced and which fixes
the origin in place.

25
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,380
And just as with two dimensions,
every point of space that we see moving around

26
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,540
is really just a proxy for a vector who
has its tip at that point,

27
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,660
and what we're really doing
is thinking about input vectors

28
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,690
*moving over* to their corresponding outputs,

29
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,339
and just as with two dimensions,

30
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,860
one of these transformations is completely described by where the basis vectors go.

31
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,680
But now, there are three standard basis
vectors that we typically use:

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,260
the unit vector in the x-direction, i-hat;

33
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,940
the unit vector in the y-direction, j-hat;

34
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,889
and a new guy—the unit vector in
the z-direction called k-hat.

35
00:01:46,889 --> 00:01:49,711
In fact, I think it's easier to think
about these transformations

36
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,340
by only following those basis vectors

37
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,760
since, the for 3-D grid representing all
points can get kind of messy

38
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,770
By leaving a copy of the original axes
in the background,

39
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:05,640
we can think about the coordinates of
where each of these three basis vectors lands.

40
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,330
Record the coordinates of these three
vectors as the columns of a 3×3 matrix.

41
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:16,530
This gives a matrix that completely describes the transformation using only nine numbers.

42
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,420
As a simple example, consider,
the transformation that rotate space

43
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,760
90 degrees around the y-axis.

44
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,600
So that would mean that it takes i-hat

45
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,760
to the coordinates [0,0,-1]
on the z-axis,

46
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,650
it doesn't move j-hat so it stays at the
coordinates [0,1,0]

47
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:40,930
and then k-hat moves over to the x-axis at
[1,0,0].

48
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,420
Those three sets of coordinates become
the columns of a matrix

49
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,300
that describes that rotation transformation.

50
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,920
To see where vector with coordinates XYZ
lands the reasoning is almost identical

51
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,420
to what it was for two dimensions—each
of those coordinates can be thought of

52
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,760
as instructions for how to scale

53
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,160
each basis vector so that they add
together to get your vector.

54
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,880
And the important part just like the 2-D case is
that this scaling and adding process

55
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,200
works both before and after the
transformation.

56
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,799
So, to see where your vector lands
you multiply those coordinates

57
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,890
by the corresponding columns of the matrix
and

58
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,910
then you add together the three results.

59
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,780
Multiplying two matrices is also similar

60
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,019
whenever you see two 3×3 matrices
getting multiplied together

61
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:40,230
you should imagine first applying the
transformation encoded by the right one

62
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,960
then applying the transformation encoded
by the left one.

63
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,679
It turns out that 3-D matrix
multiplication is actually pretty

64
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,521
important for fields like computer
graphics and robotics—since things like

65
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:54,480
rotations in three dimensions can be
pretty hard to describe, but,

66
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,580
they're easier to wrap your mind around if
you can break them down as the composition

67
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:03,180
of separate easier to think about
rotations

68
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,720
Performing this matrix multiplication
numerically, is, once again pretty similar

69
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,300
to the two-dimensional case.

70
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,800
In fact a
good way to test your understanding of

71
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,839
the last video would be to try to reason
through what specifically this matrix

72
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,979
multiplication should look like thinking
closely about how it relates to the idea

73
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,760
of applying two successive of
transformations in space.

74
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:43,960
In the next video I'll start getting
into the determinant.
