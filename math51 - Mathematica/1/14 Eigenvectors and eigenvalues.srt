1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,800
do

2
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,920
eigenvectors and eigenvalues is one of

3
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,760
those topics that a lot of students find

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,920
particularly unintuitive

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,920
questions like why are we doing this and

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,679
what does this actually mean are too

7
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,519
often left just floating away in an

8
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,680
unanswered sea of computations

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,040
and as i've put out the videos of this

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,960
series a lot of you have commented about

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,800
looking forward to visualizing this

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,360
topic in particular i suspect that the

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,040
reason for this is not so much that

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,640
eigen things are particularly

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,120
complicated or poorly explained in fact

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,960
it's comparatively straightforward and i

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,320
think most books do a fine job

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,960
explaining it the issue is that it only

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,039
really makes sense if you have a solid

20
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,120
visual understanding for many of the

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,879
topics that precede it

22
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,879
most important here is that you know how

23
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,879
to think about matrices as linear

24
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,119
transformations but you also need to be

25
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,159
comfortable with things like

26
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,799
determinants linear systems of equations

27
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,479
and change of basis

28
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,880
confusion about eigenstuffs usually has

29
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,960
more to do with the shaky foundation in

30
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,119
one of these topics than it does with

31
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,159
eigenvectors and eigenvalues themselves

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,920
to start consider some linear

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,840
transformation in two dimensions like

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,240
the one shown here it moves the basis

35
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,520
vector i hat to the coordinates 3 0 and

36
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,520
j hat to 1 2

37
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,360
so it's represented with a matrix whose

38
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,400
columns are 3 0 and 1 2.

39
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,079
focus in on what it does to one

40
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,320
particular vector and think about the

41
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,560
span of that vector the line passing

42
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,799
through its origin and its tip

43
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,479
most vectors are going to get knocked

44
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,799
off their span during the transformation

45
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,799
i mean it would seem pretty coincidental

46
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,720
if the place where the vector landed

47
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,799
also happened to be somewhere on that

48
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,040
line

49
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,439
but some special vectors do remain on

50
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,719
their own span

51
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,719
meaning the effect that the matrix has

52
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,280
on such a vector is just to stretch it

53
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,360
or squish it like a scalar

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,520
for this specific example the basis

55
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,879
vector i-hat is one such special vector

56
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,080
the span of i-hat is the x-axis and from

57
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,680
the first column of the matrix we can

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,080
see that i-hat moves over to 3 times

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,000
itself still on that x-axis

60
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,319
what's more because of the way linear

61
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,879
transformations work any other vector on

62
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,360
the x-axis is also just stretched by a

63
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,000
factor of 3 and hence remains on its own

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,319
span

65
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,319
a slightly sneakier vector that remains

66
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,440
on its own span during this

67
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,560
transformation is negative 1 1.

68
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,560
it ends up getting stretched by a factor

69
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,800
of 2.

70
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,280
and again linearity is going to imply

71
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,760
that any other vector on the diagonal

72
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,080
line spanned by this guy is just going

73
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,680
to get stretched out by a factor of 2.

74
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,760
and for this transformation those are

75
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,440
all the vectors with this special

76
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,760
property of staying on their span those

77
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,519
on the x-axis getting stretched out by a

78
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,920
factor of 3 and those on this diagonal

79
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,560
line getting stretched by a factor of 2.

80
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,400
any other vector is going to get rotated

81
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,159
somewhat during the transformation

82
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,840
knocked off the line that it spans

83
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,239
as you might have guessed by now these

84
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,760
special vectors are called the

85
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,720
eigenvectors of the transformation and

86
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,360
each eigenvector has associated with it

87
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,440
what's called an eigenvalue which is

88
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,440
just the factor by which it's stretched

89
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,360
or squished during the transformation

90
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,000
of course there's nothing special about

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,920
stretching versus squishing or the fact

92
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,360
that these eigenvalues happen to be

93
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,440
positive in another example you could

94
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,760
have an eigenvector with eigenvalue

95
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,760
negative one-half meaning that the

96
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,840
vector gets flipped and squished by a

97
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,959
factor of one-half

98
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,959
but the important part here is that it

99
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,879
stays on the line that it spans out

100
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,400
without getting rotated off of it

101
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,080
for a glimpse of why this might be a

102
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,000
useful thing to think about consider

103
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,680
some 3-dimensional rotation

104
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,159
if you can find an eigenvector for that

105
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,399
rotation a vector that remains on its

106
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,519
own span

107
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,759
what you have found is the axis of

108
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,320
rotation

109
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,800
and it's much easier to think about a 3d

110
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,880
rotation in terms of some axis of

111
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,960
rotation and an angle by which it's

112
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,280
rotating rather than thinking about the

113
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,000
full 3x3 matrix associated with that

114
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,720
transformation

115
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,080
in this case by the way the

116
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,080
corresponding eigenvalue would have to

117
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,720
be 1 since rotations never stretch or

118
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,479
squish anything so the length of the

119
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,810
vector would remain the same

120
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,840
[Music]

121
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,520
this pattern shows up a lot in linear

122
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,840
algebra with any linear transformation

123
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,919
described by a matrix you could

124
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,759
understand what it's doing by reading

125
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,680
off the columns of this matrix as the

126
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,160
landing spots for basis vectors but

127
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,160
often a better way to get at the heart

128
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,680
of what the linear transformation

129
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,960
actually does

130
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,560
less dependent on your particular

131
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,720
coordinate system is to find the

132
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,720
eigenvectors and eigenvalues

133
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,280
i won't cover the full details on

134
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,039
methods for computing eigenvectors and

135
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,039
eigenvalues here but i'll try to give an

136
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,600
overview of the computational ideas that

137
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,360
are most important for a conceptual

138
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,960
understanding

139
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,039
symbolically here's what the idea of an

140
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,880
eigenvector looks like

141
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,720
a is the matrix representing some

142
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,080
transformation with v as the eigenvector

143
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,320
and lambda is a number namely the

144
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,479
corresponding eigenvalue

145
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,400
what this expression is saying is that

146
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,039
the matrix vector product a times v

147
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,199
gives the same result as just scaling

148
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,199
the eigenvector v by some value lambda

149
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,120
so finding the eigenvectors and their

150
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,000
eigenvalues of a matrix a comes down to

151
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,400
finding the values of v and lambda that

152
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,919
make this expression true

153
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,440
it's a little awkward to work with at

154
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,039
first because that left hand side

155
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,199
represents matrix vector multiplication

156
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,360
but the right hand side here is scalar

157
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,840
vector multiplication so let's start by

158
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,919
rewriting that right hand side as some

159
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,240
kind of matrix vector multiplication

160
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,319
using a matrix which has the effect of

161
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,440
scaling any vector by a factor of lambda

162
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,360
the columns of such a matrix will

163
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,880
represent what happens to each basis

164
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,520
vector and each basis vector is simply

165
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,080
multiplied by lambda so this matrix will

166
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,639
have the number lambda down the diagonal

167
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,000
with zeros everywhere else

168
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,840
the common way to write this guy is to

169
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,160
factor that lambda out and write it as

170
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,880
lambda times i where i is the identity

171
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,600
matrix with ones down the diagonal

172
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,280
with both sides looking like matrix

173
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,440
vector multiplication we can subtract

174
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,360
off that right hand side and factor out

175
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,680
the v

176
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,560
so what we now have is a new matrix a

177
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,720
minus lambda times the identity and

178
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,120
we're looking for a vector v such that

179
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,560
this new matrix

180
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,680
times v

181
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,560
gives the zero vector

182
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,960
now this will always be true if v itself

183
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,120
is the zero vector but that's boring

184
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,240
what we want is a non-zero eigenvector

185
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,080
and if you watch chapter five and six

186
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,680
you'll know that the only way it's

187
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,599
possible for the product of a matrix

188
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,560
with a non-zero vector to become zero

189
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,880
is if the transformation associated with

190
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,440
that matrix squishes space into a lower

191
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,599
dimension

192
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,919
and that squishification corresponds to

193
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,280
a zero determinant for the matrix

194
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,360
to be concrete let's say your matrix a

195
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,039
has columns 2 1 and 2 3 and think about

196
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,000
subtracting off a variable amount lambda

197
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,319
from each diagonal entry

198
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,800
now imagine tweaking lambda turning a

199
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,880
knob to change its value

200
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,120
as that value of lambda changes the

201
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,440
matrix itself changes and so the

202
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,160
determinant of the matrix changes the

203
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,800
goal here is to find a value of lambda

204
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,199
that will make this determinant zero

205
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,280
meaning the tweaked transformation

206
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,000
squishes space into a lower dimension

207
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,840
in this case the sweet spot comes when

208
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,879
lambda equals one of course if we had

209
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,639
chosen some other matrix the eigenvalue

210
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,560
might not necessarily be 1 the sweet

211
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,160
spot might be hit at some other value of

212
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,000
lambda

213
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,599
so this is kind of a lot but let's

214
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,000
unravel what this is saying when lambda

215
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,879
equals 1 the matrix a minus lambda times

216
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,240
the identity squishes space onto a line

217
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,120
that means there's a non-zero vector v

218
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,039
such that a minus lambda times the

219
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,120
identity times v

220
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,399
equals the zero vector

221
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,159
and remember the reason we care about

222
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,040
that is because it means a times v

223
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,640
equals lambda times v

224
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,640
which you can read off as saying that

225
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,680
the vector v is an eigenvector of a

226
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,080
staying on its own span during the

227
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,240
transformation a

228
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,920
in this example the corresponding

229
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,800
eigenvalue is 1 so v would actually just

230
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,760
stay fixed in place

231
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,360
pause and ponder if you need to make

232
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,959
sure that that line of reasoning feels

233
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,279
good

234
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,880
this is the kind of thing i mentioned in

235
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,959
the introduction if you didn't have a

236
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,279
solid grasp of determinants and why they

237
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,200
relate to linear systems of equations

238
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,680
having non-zero solutions an expression

239
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,680
like this would feel completely out of

240
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,080
the blue

241
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,080
to see this in action let's revisit the

242
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,080
example from the start with a matrix

243
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,360
whose columns are 3 0 and 1 2.

244
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,600
to find if a value lambda is an

245
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,839
eigenvalue subtract it from the

246
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,080
diagonals of this matrix and compute the

247
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,080
determinant

248
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,720
doing this we get a certain quadratic

249
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,360
polynomial in lambda 3 minus lambda

250
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,680
times 2 minus lambda

251
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,160
since lambda can only be an eigenvalue

252
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,720
if this determinant happens to be 0 you

253
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,800
can conclude that the only possible

254
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,519
eigenvalues are lambda equals 2 and

255
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,839
lambda equals 3.

256
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,600
to figure out what the eigenvectors are

257
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,959
that actually have one of these

258
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,760
eigenvalues say lambda equals 2

259
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,600
plug in that value of lambda to the

260
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,880
matrix

261
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,120
and then solve for which vectors this

262
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,959
diagonally altered matrix sends to zero

263
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,640
if you computed this the way you would

264
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,800
any other linear system you'd see that

265
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,120
the solutions are all the vectors on the

266
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,120
diagonal line spanned by negative 1 1.

267
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,880
this corresponds to the fact that the

268
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,399
unaltered matrix 3 0 1 2 has the effect

269
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,560
of stretching all those vectors by a

270
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,040
factor of 2.

271
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,040
now a 2d transformation doesn't have to

272
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,760
have eigenvectors for example consider a

273
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,240
rotation by 90 degrees this doesn't have

274
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,560
any eigenvectors since it rotates every

275
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,600
vector off of its own span

276
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,399
if you actually try computing the

277
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,480
eigenvalues of a rotation like this

278
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,079
notice what happens

279
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,279
its matrix has columns 0 1 and negative

280
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,880
1 0.

281
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,880
subtract off lambda from the diagonal

282
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,480
elements and look for when the

283
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,760
determinant is zero

284
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,320
in this case you get the polynomial

285
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,720
lambda squared plus one

286
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,800
the only roots of that polynomial are

287
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,720
the imaginary numbers i and negative i

288
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,399
the fact that there are no real number

289
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,640
solutions indicates that there are no

290
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,519
eigenvectors

291
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,440
another pretty interesting example worth

292
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,279
holding in the back of your mind is a

293
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,320
shear

294
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,720
this fixes i-hat in place and moves

295
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,399
j-hat 1 over so its matrix has columns 1

296
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,720
0 and 1 1.

297
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,720
all of the vectors on the x-axis are

298
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,120
eigenvectors with eigenvalue 1 since

299
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,440
they remain fixed in place

300
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,560
in fact these are the only eigenvectors

301
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,240
when you subtract off lambda from the

302
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,279
diagonals and compute the determinant

303
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,480
what you get is 1 minus lambda squared

304
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,600
and the only root of this expression is

305
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,720
lambda equals one

306
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,920
this lines up with what we see

307
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,440
geometrically that all of the

308
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,880
eigenvectors have eigenvalue one

309
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,720
keep in mind though it's also possible

310
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,680
to have just one eigenvalue but with

311
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,120
more than just a line full of

312
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,760
eigenvectors

313
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,160
a simple example is a matrix that scales

314
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,760
everything by two

315
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,560
the only eigenvalue is two but every

316
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,320
vector in the plane gets to be an

317
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,079
eigenvector with that eigenvalue

318
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,680
now is another good time to pause and

319
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,519
ponder some of this before i move on to

320
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,920
the last topic

321
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,680
i want to finish off here with the idea

322
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,240
of an eigen basis which relies heavily

323
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,360
on ideas from the last video

324
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,519
take a look at what happens if our basis

325
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,519
vectors just so happen to be

326
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,959
eigenvectors

327
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,279
for example maybe i-hat is scaled by

328
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,360
negative 1 and j-hat is scaled by 2.

329
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,880
writing their new coordinates as the

330
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,279
columns of a matrix notice that those

331
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,160
scalar multiples negative 1 and 2 which

332
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,800
are the eigenvalues of i-hat and j-hat

333
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,519
sit on the diagonal of our matrix and

334
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,720
every other entry is a zero

335
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,040
any time a matrix has zeros everywhere

336
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,200
other than the diagonal it's called

337
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,839
reasonably enough a diagonal matrix and

338
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,760
the way to interpret this is that all

339
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,240
the basis vectors are eigenvectors with

340
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,800
the diagonal entries of this matrix

341
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,399
being their eigenvalues

342
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,240
there are a lot of things that make

343
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,560
diagonal matrices much nicer to work

344
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,680
with

345
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,519
one big one is that it's easier to

346
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,680
compute what will happen if you multiply

347
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,760
this matrix by itself a whole bunch of

348
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,199
times

349
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,680
since all one of these matrices does is

350
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,360
scale each basis vector by some

351
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,920
eigenvalue applying that matrix many

352
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,639
times say 100 times is just going to

353
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,040
correspond to scaling each basis vector

354
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,760
by the 100th power of the corresponding

355
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,600
eigenvalue

356
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,680
in contrast try computing the hundredth

357
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,320
power of a non-diagonal matrix really

358
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,399
try it for a moment it's a nightmare

359
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,240
of course you'll rarely be so lucky as

360
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,320
to have your basis vectors also be

361
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,920
eigenvectors

362
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,760
but if your transformation has a lot of

363
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,600
eigenvectors like the one from the start

364
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,760
of this video enough so that you can

365
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,040
choose a set that spans the full space

366
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,639
then you could change your coordinate

367
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,440
system so that these eigenvectors are

368
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,279
your basis vectors

369
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,800
i talked about change of basis last

370
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,639
video but i'll go through a super quick

371
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,639
reminder here of how to express a

372
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,560
transformation currently written in our

373
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,480
coordinate system into a different

374
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,240
system

375
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,839
take the coordinates of the vectors that

376
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,160
you want to use as a new basis which in

377
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,320
this case means our two eigenvectors

378
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,160
that make those coordinates the columns

379
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,880
of a matrix known as the change of basis

380
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,079
matrix

381
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,680
when you sandwich the original

382
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,360
transformation putting the change of

383
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,440
basis matrix on its right and the

384
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,680
inverse of the change of basis matrix on

385
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,560
its left the result will be a matrix

386
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,720
representing that same transformation

387
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,639
but from the perspective of the new

388
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,440
basis vector's coordinate system

389
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,800
the whole point of doing this with

390
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,680
eigenvectors is that this new matrix is

391
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,079
guaranteed to be diagonal with its

392
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,079
corresponding eigenvalues down that

393
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,320
diagonal this is because it represents

394
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,240
working in a coordinate system where

395
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,000
what happens to the basis vectors is

396
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,519
that they get scaled during the

397
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,519
transformation

398
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,440
a set of basis vectors which are also

399
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,839
eigenvectors is called again reasonably

400
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,160
enough an eigen basis

401
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,720
so if for example you needed to compute

402
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,440
the 100th power of this matrix it would

403
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,839
be much easier to change to an eigen

404
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,560
basis compute the 100th power in that

405
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,199
system then convert back to our standard

406
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,480
system

407
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,519
you can't do this with all

408
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,000
transformations a shear for example

409
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,079
doesn't have enough eigenvectors to span

410
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,519
the full space

411
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,839
but if you can find an eigen basis it

412
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,880
makes matrix operations really lovely

413
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,240
for those of you willing to work through

414
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,759
a pretty neat puzzle to see what this

415
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,440
looks like in action and how it can be

416
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,360
used to produce some surprising results

417
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,880
i'll leave up a prompt here on the

418
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,040
screen it takes a bit of work but i

419
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,639
think you'll enjoy it

420
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,279
the next and final video of this series

421
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,680
is going to be on abstract vector spaces

422
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,000
see you then
