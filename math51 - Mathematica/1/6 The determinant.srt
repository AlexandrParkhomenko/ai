1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,240
Hello, hello again.

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,330
So, moving forward

3
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,880
I will be assuming you have a visual understanding
of linear transformations

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,820
and how they're represented with matrices

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,740
the way I have been talking about in the last
few videos.

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,480
If you think about a couple of these linear
transformations

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,450
you might notice how some of them seem to
stretch space out

8
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,149
while others squish it on in.

9
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:35,129
One thing that turns out to be pretty useful
to understanding one of these transformations

10
00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:39,600
is to measure exactly how much it stretches
or squishes things.

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,600
More specifically

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:47,280
to measure the factor by which the given region
increases or decreases.

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,280
For example

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,489
look at the matrix with the columns 3, 0 and
0, 2

15
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:54,190
It scales i-hat by a factor of 3

16
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,600
and scales j-hat by a factor of 2

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,120
Now, if we focus our attention on the one
by one square

18
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,290
whose bottom sits on i-hat and whose left
side sits on j-hat.

19
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,540
After the transformation, this turns into
a 2 by 3 rectangle.

20
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,390
Since this region started out with area 1,
and ended up with area 6

21
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:18,310
we can say the linear transformation has scaled
it's area by a factor of 6.

22
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,490
Compare that to a shear

23
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,440
whose matrix has columns 1, 0 and 1, 1.

24
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,130
Meaning, i-hat stays in place and j-hat moves
over to 1, 1.

25
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,979
That same unit square determined by i-hat
and j-hat

26
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:32,320
gets slanted and turned into a parallelogram.

27
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,760
But, the area of that parallelogram is still
1

28
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,800
since it's base and height each continue to
each have length 1.

29
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,869
So, even though this transformation smushes
things about

30
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:43,469
it seems to leave areas unchanged.

31
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:46,320
At least, in the case of that one unit square.

32
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,750
Actually though

33
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,850
if you know how much the area of that one
single unit square changes

34
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:56,350
it can tell you how any possible region in
space changes.

35
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,350
For starters

36
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,090
notice that whatever happens to one square
in the grid

37
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,579
has to happen in any other square in the grid

38
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,670
no matter the size.

39
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:08,810
This follows from the fact that grid lines
remain parallel and evenly spaced.

40
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,620
Then, any shape that is not a grid square

41
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,040
can be approximated by grid squares really
well.

42
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,030
With arbitrarily good approximations if you
use small enough grid squares.

43
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,379
So, since the areas of all those tiny grid
squares are being scaled by some single amount

44
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:25,459
the area of the blob as a whole

45
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:29,010
will also be scaled also by that same single
amount.

46
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,879
This very special scaling factor

47
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,319
the factor by which a linear transformation
changes any area

48
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,180
is called the determinant of that transformation.

49
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,900
I'll show how to compute the determinate of
a transformation using it's matrix later on

50
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,900
in the video

51
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:49,659
but understanding what it is, trust me, much
more important than understanding the computation.

52
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:52,870
For example the determinant of a transformation
would be 3

53
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:58,370
if that transformation increases the area
of the region by a factor of 3.

54
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,200
The determinant of a transformation would
be 1/2

55
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,150
if it squishes down all areas by a factor
of 1/2.

56
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:09,239
And, the determinant of a 2-D transformation
is 0

57
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,170
if it squishes all of space onto a line.

58
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,129
Or, even onto a single point.

59
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:17,069
Since then, the area of any region would become
0.

60
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:19,970
That last example proved to be pretty important

61
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,420
it means checking if the determinant of a
given matrix is 0

62
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,689
will give away if computing weather or not
the transformation associated with that matrix

63
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:30,580
squishes everything into a smaller dimension.

64
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,959
You will see in the next few videos

65
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:34,480
why this is even a useful thing to think about.

66
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,110
But for now, I just want to lay down all of
the visual intuition

67
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:40,470
which, in and of itself, is a beautiful thing
to think about.

68
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,880
Ok, I need to confess that what I've said
so far is not quite right.

69
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,440
The full concept of the determinant allows
for negative values.

70
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,090
But, what would scaling an area by a negative
amount even mean?

71
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,830
This has to do with the idea of orientation.

72
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:58,830
For example

73
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,379
notice how this transformation

74
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:03,340
gives the sensation of flipping space over.

75
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,790
If you were thinking of 2-D space as a sheet
of paper

76
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:10,940
a transformation like that one seems to turn
over that sheet onto the other side.

77
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,740
Any transformations that do this are said
to "invert the orientation of space."

78
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,320
Another way to think about it is in terms
of i-hat and j-hat.

79
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,280
Notice that in their starting positions, j-hat
is to the left of i-hat.

80
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,070
If, after a transformation, j-hat is now on
the right of i-hat

81
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:32,370
the orientation of space has been inverted.

82
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,370
Whenever this happens

83
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,130
whenever the orientation of space is inverted

84
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,940
the determinant will be negative.

85
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,740
The absolute value of the determinant though

86
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,000
still tells you the factor by which areas
have been scaled.

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
For example

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,169
the matrix with columns 1, 1 and 2, -1

89
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:48,960
encodes a transformation that has determinant

90
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,960
Ill just tell you

91
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,580
-3.

92
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,580
And what this means is

93
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,960
that, space gets flipped over

94
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,900
and areas are scaled by a factor of 3.

95
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,490
So why would this idea of a negative area
scaling factor

96
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,720
be a natural way to describe orientation flipping?

97
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,710
Think about the seres of transformations you
get

98
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,810
by slowly letting i-hat get closer and closer
to j-hat.

99
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,060
As i-hat gets closer

100
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,310
all the areas in space are getting squished
more and more

101
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,919
meaning the determinant approaches 0.

102
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,180
once i-hat lines up perfectly with j-hat,

103
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,980
the determinant is 0.

104
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,110
Then, if i-hat continues the way it was going

105
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:30,190
doesn't it kinda feel natural for the determinant
to keep decreasing into the negative numbers?

106
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:34,050
So, that is the understanding of determinants
in 2 dimensions

107
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,010
what do you think it should mean for 3 dimensions?

108
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,940
It [determinant of 3x3 matrix] also tells
you how much a transformation scales things

109
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,940
but this time

110
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,699
it tells you how much volumes get scaled.

111
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:46,699
Just as in 2 dimensions

112
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:51,449
where this is easiest to think about by focusing
on one particular square with an area 1

113
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:53,569
and watching only what happens to it

114
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:54,669
in 3 dimensions

115
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:56,440
it helps to focus your attention

116
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,190
on the specific 1 by 1 by 1 cube

117
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,520
whose edges are resting on the basis vectors

118
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,789
i-hat, j-hat, and k-hat.

119
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:05,990
After the transformation

120
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,229
that cube might get warped into some kind
of slanty slanty cube

121
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:12,050
this shape by the way has the best name ever

122
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,050
parallelepiped.

123
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:18,660
A name made even more delightful when your
professor has a nice thick Russian accent.

124
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,300
Since this cube starts out with a volume of
1

125
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,550
and the determinant gives the factor by which
any volume is scaled

126
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,771
you can think of the determinant

127
00:06:25,771 --> 00:06:28,920
as simply being the volume of that parallelepiped

128
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,160
that the cube turns into.

129
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,970
A determinate of 0

130
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,479
would mean that, all of space is squished
onto something with 0 volume

131
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:41,400
meaning ether a flat plane, a line, or in
the most extreme case

132
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,840
onto a single point.

133
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,180
Those of you who watched chapter 2

134
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,330
will recognize this as meaning

135
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,860
that the columns of the matrix are linearly
dependent.

136
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:55,349
Can you see why?

137
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:56,889
What about negative determinants?

138
00:06:56,889 --> 00:06:59,259
What should that mean for 3 dimensions?

139
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:01,330
One way to describe orientation in 3-D

140
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,410
is with the right hand rule.

141
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,129
Point the forefinger of your right hand

142
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:06,949
in the direction of i-hat

143
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:09,820
stick out your middle finger in the direction
of j-hat

144
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,419
and notice how when you point your thumb up

145
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:15,319
it is in the direction of k-hat.

146
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:17,550
If you can still do that after the transformation

147
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,539
orientation has not changed

148
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,669
and the determinant is positive.

149
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:22,669
Otherwise

150
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:26,300
if after the transformation it only makes
since to do that with your left hand

151
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,819
orientation has been flipped

152
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:32,169
and the determinant is negative.

153
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:33,389
So if you haven't seen it before

154
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:34,840
you are probably wondering by now

155
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,599
"How do you actually compute the determinant?"

156
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,590
For a 2 by 2 matrix with entries a, b, c,
d

157
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:46,129
the formula is (a * d) - (b * c).

158
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:48,879
Here's part of an intuition for where this
formula comes from

159
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,639
lets say the terms b and c both happed to
be 0.

160
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,289
Then the term a tells you how much i-hat is
stretched in the x direction

161
00:07:57,289 --> 00:07:58,360
and the term d

162
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,060
tells you how much j-hat is stretched in the
y direction.

163
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,950
So, since those other terms are 0

164
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,080
it should make sense that a * d

165
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,860
gives the area of the rectangle that our favorite
unit square turns into.

166
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,699
Kinda like the 3, 0, 0, 2 example from earlier.

167
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:17,879
even if only one of b or c are 0

168
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,199
you'll have a parallelogram

169
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,699
with a base a

170
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:21,699
and a height d.

171
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:23,569
So, the area should still be

172
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,319
a times d.

173
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,490
Loosely speaking

174
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,979
if both b and c are non-0

175
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:30,530
then that b * c term

176
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,669
tells you how much this parallelogram

177
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:36,710
is stretched or squished in the diagonal direction.

178
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:40,380
For those of you hungry for a more precipice
description of this b * c term

179
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,110
here's a helpful diagram if you would like
to pause and ponder.

180
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,170
Now if you feel like computing determinants
by hand

181
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,170
is something that you need to know

182
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,200
the only way to get it down is to just

183
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,450
practice it with a few.

184
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:56,190
There's not really that much I can say or
animate that is going to drill in the computation.

185
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,200
This is all tripply true for 3-rd dimensional
determinants.

186
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
There is a formula [for that]

187
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,090
and if you feel like that is something you
need to know

188
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,080
you should practice with a few matrices

189
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,330
or you know, go watch Sal Kahn work through
a few.

190
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,330
Honestly though

191
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,910
I don't think those computations fall within
the essence of linear algebra

192
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,200
but I definitely think that knowing what the
determinate represents

193
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,350
falls within that essence.

194
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,070
Here's kind of a fun question to think about
before the next video

195
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,830
if you multiply 2 matrices together

196
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,130
the determinant of the resulting matrix

197
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:30,540
is the same as the product of the determinants
of the original two matrices

198
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,900
if you tried to justify this with numbers

199
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,640
it would take a really long time

200
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:42,430
but see if you can explain why this makes
sense in just one sentence.

201
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,430
Next up

202
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,380
I'll be relating the idea of linear transformations
covered so far

203
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,470
to one of the areas where linear algebra is
most useful

204
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,310
linear systems of equations

205
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:56,320
see ya then!
