00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,240
hey everyone grant here this is the

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,950
first video in a series on the essence

4
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,869
of calculus and I'll be publishing the

5
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:22,700
following videos once per day for the

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,369
next 10 days the goal here as the name

7
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:27,349
suggests is to really get the heart of

8
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:29,360
the subject out in one binge washable

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,849
set but with a topic that's as broad as

10
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:33,649
calculus there's a lot of things that

11
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:35,510
can mean so here's what I have in mind

12
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,300
specifically calculus has a lot of rules

13
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,190
and formulas which are often presented

14
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,020
as things to be memorized

15
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,540
lots of derivative formulas the product

16
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,130
rule the chain rule implicit

17
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,440
differentiation the fact that integrals

18
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,390
and derivatives are opposite Taylor

19
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,250
series just a lot of things like that

20
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,530
and my goal is for you to come away

21
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,030
feeling like you could have invented

22
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,700
calculus yourself that is cover all

23
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,770
those core ideas but in a way that makes

24
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,660
clear where they actually come from and

25
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,578
what they really mean using an

26
00:01:04,578 --> 00:01:07,280
all-around visual approach inventing

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,229
math is no joke and there is a

28
00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:10,850
difference between being told why

29
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,340
something's true and actually generating

30
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,770
it from scratch but at all points I want

31
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,540
you to think to yourself if you were an

32
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,520
early mathematician pondering these

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,650
ideas and drawing out the right diagrams

34
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,990
does it feel reasonable that you could

35
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,310
have stumbled across these truths

36
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:29,090
yourself in this initial video I want to

37
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,770
show how you might stumble into the core

38
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,570
ideas of calculus by thinking very

39
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,700
deeply about one specific bit of

40
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,000
geometry the area of a circle maybe you

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,530
know that this is pi times its radius

42
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,290
squared but why is there a nice way to

43
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,970
think about where this formula comes

44
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,119
from well contemplating this problem and

45
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,070
leaving yourself open to exploring the

46
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,229
interesting thoughts that come about can

47
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:52,909
actually lead you to a glimpse of three

48
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:55,190
big ideas in calculus integrals

49
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,200
derivatives and the fact that they're

50
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,650
opposites

51
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,010
but the story starts more simply just

52
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,470
you and a circle let's say with radius

53
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,840
three you're trying to figure out its

54
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,729
area and after going through a lot of

55
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,800
paper trying different ways to chop up

56
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,569
and rearrange the pieces of that area

57
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,610
many of which might lead to their own

58
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,130
interesting observations maybe you try

59
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,990
out the idea of slicing up the circle

60
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,410
into many concentric rings this should

61
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,270
seem promising because it respects the

62
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,610
symmetry of the circle and map has a

63
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,650
tendency to reward you when you respect

64
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,989
its symmetries let's take one of those

65
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:33,090
rings which has some inner radius R

66
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,020
that's between 0 & 3 if we can find a

67
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,880
nice expression for the area of each

68
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,800
ring like this one and if we have a nice

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,900
way to add them all up it might lead us

70
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,060
to an understanding of the full circles

71
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,670
area maybe you start by imagining

72
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,040
straightening out this ring

73
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,590
and you could try thinking through

74
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,750
exactly what this new shape is and what

75
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,879
its area should be but for simplicity

76
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,219
let's just approximate it as a rectangle

77
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:01,500
the width of that rectangle is the

78
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,480
circumference of the original ring which

79
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,359
is two pi times R right I mean that's

80
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:09,030
essentially the definition of pi and its

81
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,670
thickness well that depends on how

82
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,500
finely you chopped up the circle in the

83
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,599
first place which was kind of arbitrary

84
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,819
in the spirit of using what will come to

85
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,159
be standard calculus notation let's call

86
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,590
that thickness dr for a tiny difference

87
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,930
in the radius from one ring to the next

88
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,519
maybe you think of it as something like

89
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,870
0.1 so approximating this unwrapped ring

90
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,840
as a thin rectangle it's area is two pi

91
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,750
times R the radius times D are the

92
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,299
little thickness and even though that's

93
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:41,250
not perfect for smaller and smaller

94
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,650
choices of d R this is actually going to

95
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,079
be a better and better approximation for

96
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:48,299
that area since the top and the bottom

97
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:49,859
sides of this shape are going to get

98
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:51,930
closer and closer to being exactly the

99
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,720
same length so let's just move forward

100
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,699
with this approximation keeping in the

101
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:58,199
back of our minds that it's slightly

102
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:00,030
wrong but it's going to become more

103
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,949
accurate for smaller and smaller choices

104
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:04,859
of dr that is if we slice up the circle

105
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:08,099
into thinner and thinner rings so just

106
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:09,959
to sum up where we are you've broken up

107
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,000
the area of the circle into all of these

108
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,400
rings and you're approximating the area

109
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,250
of each one of those as two pi times its

110
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,220
radius times d r where the specific

111
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,500
value for that inner radius ranges from

112
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,960
zero for the smallest ring up to just

113
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,180
under three for the biggest ring spaced

114
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,159
out by whatever the thicknesses that you

115
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:31,349
choose for D are something like zero

116
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:34,380
point one and notice that the spacing

117
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,449
between the values here corresponds to

118
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:39,000
the thickness dr of each ring the

119
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,800
difference in radius from one ring to

120
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,560
the next in fact a nice way to think

121
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,360
about the rectangles approximating each

122
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,669
rings area is to fit them all up right

123
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:51,000
side by side along this axis each one

124
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,190
has a thickness D R which is why they

125
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,080
fit so snugly right there together and

126
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,789
the height of any one of these

127
00:04:56,789 --> 00:04:58,889
rectangles sitting above some specific

128
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:01,080
value of R like zero point six is

129
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,520
exactly 2 pi times

130
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,160
at value that's the circumference of the

131
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,900
corresponding ring that this rectangle

132
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,449
approximates pictures like this two PI R

133
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:11,979
can actually get kind of tall for the

134
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,319
screen I mean two times pi times three

135
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,050
is around nineteen so let's just throw

136
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,819
up a y-axis that's scaled a little

137
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,590
differently so that we can actually fit

138
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,349
all of these rectangles on the screen a

139
00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:25,030
nice way to think about this setup is to

140
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,669
draw the graph of two pi r which is a

141
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:29,500
straight line that has a slope two pi

142
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,169
each of these rectangles extends up to

143
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:34,030
the point where it just barely touches

144
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:37,210
that graph again we're being approximate

145
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,159
here each of these rectangles only

146
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,630
approximates the area of the

147
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,030
corresponding ring from the circle but

148
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,340
remember that approximation to PI R

149
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,370
times D R gets less and less wrong as

150
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,409
the size of d R gets smaller and smaller

151
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:53,530
and this has a very beautiful meaning

152
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,909
when we're looking at the sum of the

153
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:57,340
areas of all those rectangles for

154
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,710
smaller and smaller choices of dr you

155
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,120
might at first think that that turns the

156
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,250
problem into a monstrously large sum i

157
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,050
mean there's many many rectangles to

158
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,849
consider and the decimal precision of

159
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:08,259
each one of their areas is going to be

160
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:11,409
an absolute nightmare but notice all of

161
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:13,719
their areas in aggregate just looks like

162
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:16,509
the area under a graph and that portion

163
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,729
under the graph is just a triangle a

164
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:21,550
triangle with a base of 3 and a height

165
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:25,479
that's 2 pi times 3 so it's area 1/2

166
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:27,490
base times height works out to be

167
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:31,900
exactly pi times 3 squared or if the

168
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,969
radius of our original circle was some

169
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:36,759
other value capital r that area comes

170
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:39,610
out to be pi times R squared and that's

171
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,310
the formula for the area of a circle it

172
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,930
doesn't matter who you are or what you

173
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,940
typically think of math that right there

174
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,380
is a beautiful argument

175
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,669
but if you want to think like a

176
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:52,779
mathematician here

177
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,610
you don't just care about finding the

178
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,039
answer you care about developing general

179
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,710
problem-solving tools and techniques so

180
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,569
take a moment to meditate on what

181
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:03,490
exactly just happened and why it worked

182
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,620
because the way that we transitioned

183
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,330
from something approximate to something

184
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,669
precise is actually pretty subtle and it

185
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:13,499
cuts deep to what calculus is all about

186
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:15,580
you have this problem that can be

187
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,619
approximated with the sum of many small

188
00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:19,869
numbers each of which looked like 2 PI R

189
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:22,689
times D are 4 values of our ranging

190
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:25,919
between 0 & 3

191
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,430
remember the small numbered er here

192
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,530
represents our choice for the thickness

193
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,740
of each ring for example 0.1 and there

194
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,320
are two important things to note here

195
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,690
first of all not only is dr a factor in

196
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,610
the quantities we're adding up to PI R

197
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,400
times D R it also gives the spacing

198
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,639
between the different values of R and

199
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:48,650
secondly the smaller our choice for dr

200
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,580
the better the approximation adding all

201
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,930
of those numbers could be seen in a

202
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,820
different pretty clever way as adding

203
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,130
the areas of many thin rectangles

204
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,560
sitting underneath a graph the graph of

205
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,410
the function 2 pi r in this case then

206
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:06,110
and this is key by considering smaller

207
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,720
and smaller choices for dr corresponding

208
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,490
to better and better approximations of

209
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,919
the original problem this some thought

210
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:14,990
of as the aggregate area of those

211
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,750
rectangles approaches the area under the

212
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,240
graph and because of that you can

213
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,070
conclude that the answer to the original

214
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,260
question in full-on approximated

215
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,050
precision is exactly the same as the

216
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,870
area underneath this graph

217
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,440
a lot of other hard problems in math and

218
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,270
science can be broken down and

219
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,640
approximated as the sum of many small

220
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,279
quantities things like figuring out how

221
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:42,349
far a car has traveled based on its

222
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:44,990
velocity at each point in time in a case

223
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,670
like that you might range through many

224
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,470
different points in time and at each one

225
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,560
multiply the velocity at that time times

226
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,529
a tiny change in time DT which would

227
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:55,880
give the corresponding little bit of

228
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,740
distance traveled during that little

229
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,320
time I'll talk through the details of

230
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,210
examples like this later in the series

231
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,000
but at a high level many of these types

232
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,220
of problems turn out to be equivalent to

233
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,529
finding the area under some graph in

234
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:11,480
much the same way that our circle

235
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,150
problem did this happens whenever the

236
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,589
quantities that you're adding up

237
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:17,690
the one whose sum approximates the

238
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,820
original problem can be thought of as

239
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,010
the areas of many thin rectangles

240
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,779
sitting side-by-side like this

241
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:27,380
if finer and finer approximations of the

242
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,480
original problem correspond to thinner

243
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,730
and thinner rings then the original

244
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,560
problem is going to be equivalent to

245
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,860
finding the area under some graph again

246
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,810
this is an idea we'll see in more detail

247
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,120
later in the series so don't worry if

248
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,010
it's not 100% clear right now

249
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,920
the point now is that you as the

250
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,750
mathematician having just solved a

251
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,550
problem by reframing it as the area

252
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,250
under a graph might start thinking about

253
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,320
how to find the areas under other graphs

254
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,020
I mean we were lucky in the circle

255
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,670
problem that the relevant area turned

256
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,770
out to be a triangle but imagine instead

257
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:03,410
something like a parabola the graph of x

258
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,350
squared what's the area underneath that

259
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,140
curve say between the values of x equals

260
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:13,310
zero and x equals three well it's hard

261
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,010
to think about right and let me reframe

262
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,360
that question in a slightly different

263
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:17,810
way

264
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:20,480
we'll fix that left endpoint in place at

265
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,910
zero and let the right endpoint vary

266
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,259
are you able to find a function a of X

267
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:31,569
that gives you the area under this

268
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:36,279
parabola between 0 and X a function a of

269
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:38,799
X like this is called an integral of

270
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:41,559
x-squared calculus holds within it the

271
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:43,479
tools to figure out what an integral

272
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:46,029
like this is but right now it's just a

273
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:48,129
mystery function to us we know it gives

274
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:50,079
the area under the graph of x squared

275
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,179
between some fixed left point and some

276
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:54,069
variable right point but we don't know

277
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:57,129
what it is and again the reason we care

278
00:10:57,129 --> 00:10:59,019
about this kind of question is not just

279
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:01,179
for the sake of asking hard geometry

280
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:03,759
questions it's because many practical

281
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:05,589
problems that can be approximated by

282
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:07,779
adding up a large number of small things

283
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:10,539
can be reframed as a question about an

284
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:14,049
area under a certain graph and I'll tell

285
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,639
you right now that finding this area

286
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:18,579
this integral function is genuinely hard

287
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:21,220
and whenever you come across a genuinely

288
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,769
hard question in math a good policy is

289
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:25,809
to not try too hard to get at the answer

290
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:28,029
directly since usually you just end up

291
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:30,249
banging your head against a wall instead

292
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:32,439
play around with the idea with no

293
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:34,839
particular goal in mind spend some time

294
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:36,489
building up familiarity with the

295
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:38,470
interplay between the function defining

296
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,139
the graph in this case x squared and the

297
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:43,700
function giving the area

298
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,070
in that playful spirit if you're lucky

299
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,950
here's something that you might notice

300
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,900
when you slightly increase X by some

301
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,990
tiny nudge DX look at the resulting

302
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,240
change in area represented with this

303
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,940
sliver that I'm going to call da for a

304
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,510
tiny difference in area that sliver can

305
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,010
be pretty well approximated with a

306
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,590
rectangle one whose height is x squared

307
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:10,190
and whose width is DX and the smaller

308
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,070
the size of that nudge DX the more that

309
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,380
sliver actually looks like a rectangle

310
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,450
now this gives us an interesting way to

311
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,550
think about how a of X is related to

312
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,580
x-squared a change to the output of a

313
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,580
this little da is about equal to x

314
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,770
squared where X is whatever input you

315
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,990
started at x DX

316
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,880
the little nudge to the input that

317
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,240
caused a to change or rearranged da

318
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,660
divided by DX the ratio of a tiny change

319
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,090
in a to the tiny change in X that caused

320
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,670
it is approximately whatever x squared

321
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,920
is at that point and that's an

322
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,570
approximation that should get better and

323
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,400
better for smaller and smaller choices

324
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,610
of DX in other words we don't know what

325
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,400
a of X is that remains a mystery but we

326
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,440
do know a property that this mystery

327
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,990
function must have when you look at two

328
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,410
nearby points for example 3 & 3 point 0

329
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,130
0 1

330
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,710
consider the change to the output of a

331
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:10,230
between those two points the difference

332
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,390
between the mystery function evaluated

333
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,890
at 3.00 1 and evaluated at 3 that change

334
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,990
divided by the difference in the input

335
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:22,050
values which in this case is 0.001

336
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,750
should be about equal to the value of x

337
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,970
squared for the starting input in this

338
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,440
case 3 squared

339
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,350
in this relationship between tiny

340
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,450
changes to the mystery function and the

341
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,880
values of x-squared itself is true at

342
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,850
all inputs not just three that doesn't

343
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,680
immediately tell us how to find a of X

344
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,990
but it provides a very strong clue that

345
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,769
we can work with

346
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:47,629
and there's nothing special about the

347
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:49,910
graph x squared here any function

348
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,459
defined as the area under some graph has

349
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:55,550
this property that da divided by DX a

350
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,459
slight nudge to the output of a divided

351
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:00,079
by a slight nudge to the input that

352
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,629
caused it is about equal to the height

353
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:06,769
of the graph at that point again that's

354
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:08,269
an approximation that gets better and

355
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:11,139
better for smaller choices of DX and

356
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:13,939
here we're stumbling into another big

357
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:17,149
idea from calculus derivatives this

358
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:20,089
ratio da divided by DX is called the

359
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:23,119
derivative of a or more technically the

360
00:14:23,119 --> 00:14:24,470
derivative is whatever this ratio

361
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,779
approaches as DX gets smaller and

362
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:29,449
smaller although I've much more deeply

363
00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:30,980
into the idea of a derivative in the

364
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,499
next video but loosely speaking it's a

365
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:35,509
measure of how sensitive a function is

366
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:38,239
to small changes in its input you'll see

367
00:14:38,239 --> 00:14:39,860
as the series goes on that there are

368
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,899
many many ways that you can visualize a

369
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:43,910
derivative depending on what function

370
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,959
you're looking at and how you think

371
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,459
about tiny nudges to its output

372
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,750
and we care about derivatives because

373
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,940
they help us solve problems and in our

374
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,949
little exploration here we already have

375
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:56,660
a slight glimpse of one way that they're

376
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,029
used they are the key to solving

377
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:01,339
integral questions problems that require

378
00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:04,610
finding the area under a curve once you

379
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,440
gain enough familiarity with computing

380
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,449
derivatives you'll be able to look at a

381
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,430
situation like this one where you don't

382
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,410
know what a function is but you do know

383
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,970
that its derivative should be x squared

384
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,269
and from that reverse engineer what the

385
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:21,529
function must be and this back and forth

386
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:24,230
between integrals and derivatives where

387
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,819
the derivative of a function for the

388
00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:28,459
area under a graph gives you back the

389
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:30,310
function defining the graph itself is

390
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,630
called the fundamental theorem of

391
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,449
calculus it ties together the two big

392
00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:37,819
ideas of integrals and derivatives and

393
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:40,910
it shows how in some sense each one is

394
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,990
an inverse of the other

395
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:46,699
all of this is only a high-level view

396
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:48,709
just a peek at some of the core ideas

397
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:51,019
that emerge in calculus and what follows

398
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:52,699
in the series are the details for

399
00:15:52,699 --> 00:15:55,100
derivatives and integrals and more at

400
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,050
all points I want you to feel that you

401
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,029
could have invented calculus yourself

402
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:01,250
that if you drew the right pictures and

403
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,899
played with each idea in just the right

404
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:05,240
way these formulas and rules and

405
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,190
constructs that are presented could have

406
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,019
just as easily popped out naturally from

407
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:13,339
your own explorations and before you go

408
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,899
it would feel wrong not to give the

409
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:16,370
people who supported this series on

410
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,920
patreon a well-deserved thanks both for

411
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,839
their financial backing as well as for

412
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:22,639
the suggestions they gave while the

413
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,870
series was being developed

414
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,389
you see supporters got early access to

415
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:28,310
the videos as I made them and they'll

416
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,139
continue to get early access for future

417
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:32,870
essence of type series and as a thanks

418
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,649
to the community

419
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:35,600
I keep ads off of new videos for their

420
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,209
first month I'm still astounded that I

421
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:39,889
can spend time working on videos like

422
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:42,680
these and in a very direct way you are

423
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,430
the one to thank for that

425
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,880
