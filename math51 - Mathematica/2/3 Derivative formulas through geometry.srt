1
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,000
Now that we've seen what a derivative means, and what it has to do with rates of change.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Our next step is to learn how to actually compute these guys, as in if I give you some kind of function

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,100
with an explicit formula you'd want to be able to find what the formula for its derivative is.

4
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:31,000
Maybe it's obvious, but I think it's worth stating explicitly why this is an important thing

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to be able to do. Why much of a calculus students time ends up going towards grappling with

6
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:41,800
derivatives of abstract functions rather than thinking about concrete rate of change problems,

7
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,200
Is because a lot of real-world phenomena. The sort of things that we want to use calculus

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,500
to analyze are modeled using polynomials, trigonometric functions, exponential's

9
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,100
and other pure functions like that. So if you build up some fluency with the ideas

10
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:01,500
of rates of change for those kinds of pure abstract functions. It gives you a language to more

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,099
readily talk about the rates at which things change in concrete situations that you might be

12
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:12,300
using calculus to model. But it is way too easy for this process to feel like just memorizing a list

13
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:17,000
of rules. And if that happens, if you get that feeling it's all so easy to lose sight of the fact that

14
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,600
derivatives are fundamentally about just looking at tiny changes to some quantity,

15
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:25,900
and how that relates to a resulting tiny change in another quantity. So in this video

16
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,900
and in the next one, my aim is to show you how you can think about a few of these rules intuitively

17
00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:34,900
and geometrically. And I really want to encourage you to never forget that tiny nudges

18
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,149
are at the heart of derivatives. let's start with a simple function like f(x) = x^2, what if I asked

19
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:48,300
you it's derivative. That is if you were to look at some value x like x = 2 and compare it to a value

20
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,300
slightly bigger, just dx bigger. What's the corresponding change in the value of the

21
00:01:53,359 --> 00:02:00,400
function df, and in particular what's df divided by dx - The rate at which this function is changing

22
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:07,200
per unit change in x as a first step for intuition. We know that you can think of this ratio df/dx

23
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:13,400
as the slope of a tangent line to the graph of x^2, and from that you can see that the slope

24
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,209
generally increases as x increases. At 0 the tangent line is flat so the slope is 0 at x = 1.

25
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:27,000
That's something a bit steeper at x = 2, it's steeper still but looking at graphs isn't generally the

26
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,760
best way to understand the precise formula for a derivative, for that it's best to take

27
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,400
a more literal look at what x^2 actually means. And in this case let's go ahead and picture a square

28
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:41,030
whose side length is x if you increase x by some tiny nudge, some little dx.

29
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:48,900
What's the resulting change in the area of that square, that slight change, in area

30
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:56,100
is what df means in this context. It's the tiny increase to the value of f(x) = x^2 caused by

31
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,450
increasing x by that tiny nudge dx. Now you can see that there's three new bits of area in this diagram, two thin

32
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:08,600
rectangles and a miniscule square. The two thin rectangles each have side lengths of x and dx

33
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:17,400
so they account for two times x * dx units of new area. For example let's say x was 3 and dx was 0.01.

34
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,300
Then that new area from these two thin rectangles would be 2 * 3 * 0.01 which is 0.06,

35
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,410
about 6 times the size of dx. That little square there has an area of dx^2, but you should

36
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:38,700
think of that as being really tiny, negligibly tiny. For example, if dx was 0.01, that would be only 0.0001.

37
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:47,800
And keep in mind, I'm drawing DX with a fair bit of width here just so we can actually

38
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:53,100
see it, but always remember - in principle dx should be thought of as a truly tiny amount

39
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:59,700
and for those truly tiny amounts. A good rule of thumb is that you can ignore anything that includes a dx

40
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:07,800
raised to a power greater than 1. That is a tiny change squared is a negligible change what this leaves us with

41
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:15,800
is that df is just some multiple of dx, and that multiple 2x which you could also write as df/dx

42
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:23,200
is the derivative of x^2. For example, if you were starting at x = 3, then as you slightly increase x

43
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:31,800
the rate of change in the area per unit change in length added dx^2/dx would be 2 * 3 or 6.

44
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:40,900
And if instead you were starting at x = 5, the rate of change would be ten units of area per unit change in x.

45
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:47,300
Let's go ahead and try a different simple function f(x) = x^3. This is going to be the geometric view

46
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:52,800
of the stuff that I went through algebraically in the last video. What's nice here is that we can think of x^3

47
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,940
as the volume of an actual cube, whose side lengths are x. And when you increase x by a tiny nudge, a tiny dx

48
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:07,400
the resulting increase in volume is what I have here in yellow. That represents all the volume in a cube

49
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,800
with side lengths x plus dx. That's not already in the original cube, the one with side length x.

50
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,400
It's nice to think of this new volume as broken up into multiple components, but almost all of it comes

51
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,390
from these three square faces, or set a little more precisely as dx approaches zero.

52
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:29,500
Precisely as dx approaches zero, those three squares comprise a portion closer and closer to 100%

53
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:38,100
of that new yellow volume. Each of those thin squares has a volume of x^2 * dx,

54
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:46,200
the area of the face times that little thickness dx. So in total this gives us 3x^2 dx of volume change.

55
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:52,800
And to be sure there are other slivers of volume here, along the edges, and that tiny one in the corner. But all

56
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,700
of that volume is going to be proportional to dx^2 or dx^3 so we can safely ignore them.

57
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:05,500
Again this is ultimately because they're going to be divided by dx, and if there's still any dx remaining

58
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:12,100
then those terms aren't going to survive the process of letting dx approach 0. What this means is

59
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:20,700
that the derivative of x^3, the rate at which x^3 changes per unit change of x is 3x^2.

60
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:24,759
What that means in terms of graphical intuition is that the slope of the graph of x^3

61
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:36,000
at every single point x is exactly 3x^2. And reasoning about that slope, it should make sense

62
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:43,100
that this derivative is high on the left, and then zero at the origin, and then high again as you move to the right.

63
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:48,900
But just thinking in terms of the graph would never have landed us on the precise quantity 3x^2.

64
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:55,200
For that we had to take a much more direct look at what x^3 actually means now in practice.

65
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,400
You wouldn't necessarily think of the square every time you're taking the derivative of x^2. Nor would

66
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:06,000
you necessarily think of this cube whenever you're taking the derivative of x^3, both of them fall under a pretty

67
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:13,600
recognizable pattern for polynomial terms the derivative of x^4 turns out to be 4x^3. The derivative

68
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:26,600
of x^5 is 5x^4. The derivative of x to the n for any power n is nx^(n-1).

69
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:32,200
This right here is what's known in the business as the power rule. In practice

70
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:36,500
we all quickly just get jaded and think about this symbolically as the exponent

71
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:41,700
hopping down in front leaving behind one less than itself. Rarely pausing to think about the

72
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:46,000
geometric delights that underlie these derivatives. That's the kind of thing

73
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,700
that happens when these tend to fall in the middle of much longer computations.

74
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:55,300
But rather than tracking it all off to symbolic patterns let's just take a moment and think about why this works.

75
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:03,900
For powers beyond just 2 and 3 when you nudge that input x, increasing it slightly to x + dx, working out the

76
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:10,800
exact value of that nudged output would involve multiplying together these n separate x + dx terms.

77
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,700
The full expansion would be really complicated but part of the point of derivatives is that most of that

78
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:23,600
complication can be ignored. The first term in your expansion is x^n, this is analogous to the

79
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:30,500
area of the original square or the volume of the original cube from our previous examples.

80
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:43,200
For the next terms in the expansion, you can choose mostly x's with a single dx since there are

81
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:50,100
n radicals from which you could have chosen that single dx. This gives us n separate terms all of which include

82
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:59,500
n-1 x's times a dx giving a value of x^(n-1) times dx. This is analogous to how the majority of

83
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:04,600
the new area in the square came from those two bars each with area x * dx,

84
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,900
or how the bulk of the new volume in the cube came from those three thin squares.

85
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:16,800
Each of which had a volume of x^2 times dx. There will be many other terms of this expansion

86
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,900
but all of them are just going to be some multiple of dx^2 so we can safely ignore them.

87
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:26,800
And what that means is that all but a negligible portion of the increase in the output

88
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:32,700
comes from n copies of this x to the (n-1) * dx - that's what it means.

89
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:41,500
For the derivative of x^n to be n * x^(n-1) and even though, like I said in practice, you'll find

90
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,500
yourself performing this derivative quickly and symbolically imagining the exponent,

91
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:52,900
hopping down to the front. Every now and then it's nice to just step back and remember why these rules work.

92
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,900
Not just because it's pretty, and not just because it helps remind us that math actually makes sense

93
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:02,800
and isn't just a pile of formulas to memorize. But because it flexes that very important muscle of

94
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:12,000
thinking about derivatives in terms of tiny nudges. As another example think of the function f(x) = 1/x.

95
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,200
Now, on the one hand you could just blindly try applying the power rule since 1/x

96
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:24,000
is the same as writing x^(-1). That would involve letting the negative 1 hop down in front

97
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:30,600
leaving behind 1 less than itself which is -2. But let's have some fun and see if we can reason about this

98
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:38,500
geometrically rather than just plugging it through some formula. The value 1/x is asking what number

99
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,900
multiplied by x equals 1, so here's how I'd like to visualize it - imagine a little

100
00:10:43,949 --> 00:10:50,300
rectangular puddle of water sitting in two dimensions whose area is 1, and let's say that its width is x.

101
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:57,400
Which means that the height has to be 1/x since the total area of it is 1, so if x was

102
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:03,300
stretched out to 2 then that height is forced down to 1/2 and if you increased x up to 3

103
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:10,000
then the other side has to be squished down to 1/3 this is a nice way to think about the graph of 1/x.

104
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,900
By the way, if you think of this with x of the puddle as being in the xy plane then that corresponding output 1/x,

105
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,160
the height of the graph above that point is whatever the height of your puddle has to be to maintain an area of 1.

106
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:32,500
So with this visual in mind for the derivative, imagine nudging up that value of x by some tiny amount,

107
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:39,200
some tiny dx. How must the height of this rectangle change so that the area of the puddle remains

108
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:45,400
constant at 1 - That is increasing the width by dx, add some new area to the right here so the puddle

109
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:54,900
has to decrease in height by some d(1/x) so that the area lost off of that top cancels out the area gained.

110
00:11:54,900 --> 00:12:01,400
You should think of that d(1/x) as being a negative amount. By the way since it's decreasing the height

111
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,949
of the rectangle and you know what I'm

112
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:06,389
going to leave the last few steps here

113
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:08,399
for you for you to pause and ponder and

114
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,829
work out an ultimate expression and once

115
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:13,860
you reason out what D of 1 over X / DX

116
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,870
should be I want you to compare it to

117
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,250
what you would have gotten if you had

118
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,899
just blindly applied the power rule

119
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,220
purely symbolically

120
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:20,730
to

121
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,810
X to the negative one and while I'm

122
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,490
encouraging a deposit ponder here's

123
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,899
another fun challenge if you're feeling

124
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:30,060
up to it see if you can reason through

125
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,070
what the derivative of the square root

126
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,790
of x should be

127
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,380
to finish things off I want to tackle

128
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,600
one more type of function trigonometric

129
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,910
functions and in particular let's focus

130
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,029
on the sine function so for this section

131
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:47,170
I'm going to assume that you're already

132
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,120
familiar with how to think about trig

133
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,699
functions using the unit circle the

134
00:12:51,699 --> 00:12:53,560
circle with the radius one centered at

135
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,389
the origin

136
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:57,579
for a given value of theta like say zero

137
00:12:57,579 --> 00:12:59,620
point eight you imagine yourself walking

138
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,449
around the circle starting from the

139
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:03,310
rightmost point until you've traversed

140
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,980
that distance of zero point eight in arc

141
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,350
length this is the same thing as saying

142
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,449
that the angle right here is exactly

143
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:11,769
theta radians

144
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:14,009
since the circle has a radius of one

145
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:17,259
then what sine of theta means is the

146
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:19,720
height of that point above the x-axis

147
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,930
and as your theta value increases and

148
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,120
you walk around the circle your height

149
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,370
Bob's up and down between negative one

150
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,730
and one so when you graph sine of theta

151
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,459
versus theta you get this wave pattern

152
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:37,080
the quintessential wave pattern

153
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,480
and just from looking at this graph we

154
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,490
can start to get a feel for the shape of

155
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,640
the derivative of the sine the slope at

156
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,130
zero is something positive since sine of

157
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,160
theta is increasing there and as we move

158
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,300
to the right and sine of theta

159
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,730
approaches its peak that slope goes down

160
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,940
to zero then the slope is negative for a

161
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,650
little while while the sine is

162
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,750
decreasing before coming back up to zero

163
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,800
as the sine graph levels out and as you

164
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,180
continue thinking this through and

165
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,950
drawing it out if you're familiar with

166
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,930
the graph of trig functions you might

167
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,120
guess that this derivative graph should

168
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,850
be exactly cosine of theta since all the

169
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,590
peaks and valleys line up perfectly with

170
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,030
where the peaks and valleys for the

171
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,820
cosine function should be and spoiler

172
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,740
alert the derivative is in fact the

173
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,050
cosine of theta but aren't you a little

174
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,330
curious about why it's precisely cosine

175
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,400
of theta I mean you could have all sorts

176
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,080
of functions with peaks and valleys at

177
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,610
the same points that have roughly the

178
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,650
same shape but who knows maybe the

179
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,120
derivative of sine could have turned out

180
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,100
to be some entirely new type of function

181
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,050
that just happens to have a similar

182
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,540
shape well just like the previous

183
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,480
examples a more exact understanding of

184
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,250
the derivative requires looking at what

185
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,350
the function actually represents rather

186
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,670
than looking at the graph of the

187
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,370
function so think back to that walk

188
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,710
around the unit circle having traversed

189
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,870
an arc with length theta and thinking

190
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,640
about sine of theta as the height of

191
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,300
that point

192
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,670
now zoom in to that point on the circle

193
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,280
and consider a slight nudge of D theta

194
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,100
along their circumference a tiny step in

195
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,800
your walk around the unit circle how

196
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,080
much does that tiny step change the sign

197
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,840
of theta how much does this increase D

198
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,000
theta of arc length increase the height

199
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,670
above the x-axis

200
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,500
well zoomed in close enough the circle

201
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,090
basically looks like a straight line in

202
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,830
this neighborhood so let's go ahead and

203
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,080
think of this right triangle where the

204
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,580
hypotenuse of that right triangle

205
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,280
represents the nudge D theta along the

206
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,680
circumference and that left side here

207
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,690
represents the change in height the

208
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,570
resulting D sine of theta now this tiny

209
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,670
triangle is actually similar to this

210
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,890
larger triangle here with the defining

211
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,440
angle theta and whose hypotenuse is the

212
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,460
radius of the circle with length one

213
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,930
specifically this little angle right

214
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:56,400
here is precisely equal to theta radians

215
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,050
now think about what the derivative of

216
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,780
sine is supposed to mean it's the ratio

217
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,360
between that D sine of theta the tiny

218
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,880
change to the height divided by D theta

219
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,860
the tiny change to the input of the

220
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,710
function and from the picture we can see

221
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,660
that that's the ratio between the length

222
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,960
of the side adjacent to the angle theta

223
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,180
divided by the hypotenuse well let's see

224
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,910
adjacent divided by hypotenuse that's

225
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,890
exactly what the cosine of theta means

226
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,980
that's the definition of the cosine

227
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,080
so this gives us two different really

228
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,430
nice ways of thinking about how the

229
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:33,490
derivative of sine is cosine one of them

230
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,990
is looking at the graph and getting a

231
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,850
loose feel for the shape of things based

232
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,680
on thinking about the slope of the sine

233
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,290
graph at every single point and the

234
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,850
other is a more precise line of

235
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,530
reasoning looking at the unit circle

236
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:48,010
itself for those of you that like to

237
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,810
pause and ponder see if you can try a

238
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,790
similar line of reasoning to find what

239
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,560
the derivative of the cosine of theta

240
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,730
should be in the next video I'll talk

241
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,290
about how you can take derivatives of

242
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,360
functions who combine simple functions

243
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,400
like these ones either as sums or

244
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,410
products or function compositions things

245
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,720
like that and similar to this video the

246
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,220
goal is going to be to understand each

247
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,470
one geometrically in a way that makes it

248
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,270
intuitively reasonable and somewhat more

249
00:17:28,864 --> 00:17:30,924
you

250
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:33,344
you
