00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,860
Picture yourself as an early calculus student
 about to begin your first course:

3
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:10,409
The months ahead of you
 hold within them a lot of hard work

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:16,680
Some neat examples, some not so neat examples, beautiful connections to physics, not so beautiful piles of formulas to memorise,

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:22,619
plenty of moments of getting stuck and banging your head into a wall, a few nice 'aha' moments sprinkled in as well, and

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,820
some genuinely lovely graphical intuition to help guide you through it all.

7
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:33,689
But if the course ahead of you is anything like my first introduction to calculus or any of the first courses that I've seen in

8
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:39,390
the years since, there's one topic that you will not see, but which I believe stands to greatly accelerate your learning.

9
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,430
You see almost all of the visual intuitions from that first year are based on graphs -

10
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:49,469
the derivative is the slope of a graph, the integral is a certain area under that graph,

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,360
but as you generalize calculus beyond functions whose inputs and outputs are simply numbers,

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,779
it's not always possible to graph the function that you're analyzing. There's all sorts of different ways that you'd be visualizing these things

13
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,809
so if all your intuitions for the fundamental ideas,

14
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:09,268
like derivatives, are rooted too rigidly in graphs, it can make for a very tall and largely unnecessary

15
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:17,220
conceptual hurdle between you and the more "advanced topics", like multivariable calculus, and complex analysis, differential geometry....

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,209
Now, what I want to share with you is a way to think about derivatives

17
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:29,189
which I'll refer to as the transformational view, that generalizes more seamlessly into some of those more general context where calculus comes up

18
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,769
And then we'll use this alternate view to analyze a certain fun puzzle about repeated fractions.

19
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:39,689
But first off, I just want to make sure that we're all on the same page about what the standard visual is.

20
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,490
If you were to graph a function,

21
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,740
which simply takes real numbers as inputs and outputs, one of the first things you learn in a calculus course

22
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,979
is that the derivative gives you the slope of this graph.

23
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:58,110
Where what we mean by that is that the derivative of the function is a new function which for every input x returns that slope

24
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:04,169
Now, I'd encourage you not to think of this derivative as slope idea as being the definition of a derivative

25
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,559
instead think of it as being more fundamentally about how sensitive the function is to tiny little nudges around the input and

26
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:16,820
the slope is just one way to think about that sensitivity relevant only to this particular way of viewing functions.

27
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:21,529
I have not just another video, but a full series on this topic if it's something you want to learn more about.

28
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,230
Now the basic idea behind the alternate visual for the derivative is to think of this function as

29
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,719
mapping all of the input points on the number line to their corresponding outputs on a different number line.

30
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:40,099
In this context what the derivative gives you is a measure of how much the input space gets stretched or squished in various regions.

31
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:48,169
That is if you were to zoom in around a specific input and take a look at some evenly spaced points around it,

32
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:53,570
the derivative of the function of that input is going to tell you how spread out or

33
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,599
contracted those points become after the mapping.

34
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,709
Here a specific example helps take the function x squared

35
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,569
it maps 1 to 1 and 2 to 4 3 to 9 and so on

36
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,930
and you could also see how it acts on all of the points in between

37
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,819
and if you were to zoom in on a little cluster of points around the input 1 and

38
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:22,160
then see where they land around the relevant output which for this function also happens to be 1

39
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,010
you'd notice that they tend to get stretched out in.

40
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:32,240
In fact, it roughly looks like stretching out by a factor of 2 and the closer you zoom in the more this local behavior

41
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,540
Looks just like multiplying by a factor of 2.

42
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,690
This is what it means for the derivative of x squared at the input x equals 1 to be 2.

43
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,379
It's what that fact looks like in the context of transformations.

44
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:52,010
If you looked at a neighborhood of points around the input 3, they would get roughly stretched out by a factor of 6.

45
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:57,109
This is what it means for the derivative of this function at the input 3 to equal 6.

46
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:02,959
Around the input 1/4 a small region actually tends to get contracted

47
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:08,209
specifically by a factor of 1/2 and that's what it looks like for a derivative to be smaller than 1.

48
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,360
Now the input 0 is interesting,
zooming in by a factor of 10

49
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:20,329
It doesn't really look like a constant stretching or squishing, for one thing all of the outputs end up on the right

50
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:22,489
positive side of things

51
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,030
and as you zoom in closer and closer by 100x or by 1000 X

52
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:33,480
It looks more and more like a small neighborhood of points around zero just gets collapsed into zero itself.

53
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:42,509
And this is what it looks like for the derivative to be zero, the local behavior looks more and more like

54
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:50,040
multiplying the whole number line by zero. It doesn't have to completely collapse everything to a point at a particular zoom level. Instead

55
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,670
it's a matter of what the limiting behavior is as you zoom in closer and closer.

56
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,229
It's also instructive to take a look at the negative inputs here.

57
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,159
Things start to feel a little cramped since they collide with where all the positive input values go,

58
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:11,860
and this is one of the downsides of thinking of functions as transformations, but for derivatives, we only really care about the local behavior

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,420
Anyway, what happens in a small range around a given input.

60
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:23,680
Here, notice that the inputs in a little neighborhood around say negative two. They don't just get stretched out -  they also get flipped around.

61
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:31,529
Specifically, the action on such a neighborhood looks more and more like multiplying by negative four the closer you zoom in

62
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,760
this is what it looks like for the derivative of a function to be negative

63
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,590
and I think you get the point. This is all well and good,

64
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,859
but let's see how this is actually useful in solving a problem a

65
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:50,519
Friend of mine recently asked me a pretty fun question about the infinite fraction one plus one divided by one plus one divided by one

66
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,009
plus one divided by one on and on and on and on and

67
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,560
Clearly you watch math videos online

68
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,170
So maybe you've seen this before but my friend's question actually cuts to something that you might not have thought about before

69
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,080
Relevant to the view of derivatives that we're looking at here

70
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,130
the typical way that you might

71
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:13,230
Evaluate an expression like this is to set it equal to X and then notice that there's a copy of the full fraction inside itself

72
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,570
So you can replace that copy with another X and then just solve for X

73
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:24,330
That is what you want is to find a fixed point of the function 1 plus 1 divided by X

74
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:34,139
But here's the thing there are actually two solutions for X two special numbers were one plus one divided by that number

75
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,660
Gives you back the same thing

76
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:42,270
One is the golden ratio phi Φ φ around 1.618
 and the other is negative

77
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,260
0.618 which happens to be -1/φ.

78
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:52,919
I like to call this other number phi's little brother since just about any property that phi has, this number also has and

79
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,120
this raises the question:

80
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:02,519
'Would it be valid to say that that infinite fraction that we saw, is somehow also equal to phi's little brother: -0.618?'

81
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:11,040
Maybe you initially say ",obviously not! Everything on the left hand side is positive. So how could it possibly equal a negative number?"

82
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,529
Well first we should be clear about what we actually mean by an expression like this.

83
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,990
One way that you could think about it,

84
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:24,930
and it's not the only way there's freedom for choice here, is to imagine starting with some constant like 1 and then

85
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,560
repeatedly applying the function 1 plus 1 divided by x and

86
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,150
then asking what is this approach as you keep going?

87
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:39,420
I mean certainly symbolically what you get looks more and more like our infinite fraction

88
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:43,769
so maybe if you wanted to equal a number you should ask what this series of numbers approaches and

89
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,059
If that's your view of things,
maybe you start off with a negative number

90
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,149
So it's not so crazy for the whole expression to end up negative.

91
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,400
After all

92
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,650
If you start with -1/φ then applying this function 1 + 1/x

93
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:03,719
You get back the same number -1/φ. So no matter how many times you apply it

94
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,720
you're staying fixed at this value.

95
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:14,128
But even then there is one reason that you should probably view phi as the favorite brother in this pair, here

96
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:16,259
try this: pull up a calculator of some kind

97
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:21,809
then start with any random number and then plug it into this function 1 + 1/x and

98
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:27,989
then plug that number into 1 + 1/x  and then again and again and again and again and again

99
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:31,829
No matter what constant you start with you eventually end up at

100
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:33,610
1.618

101
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:38,339
Even if you start with a negative number even one that's really really close to phi's little brother

102
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:43,229
Eventually it shys away from that value and jumps back over to phi

103
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:55,550
So what's going on here? Why is one of these fixed points favored above the other one?

104
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,170
Maybe you can already see how the

105
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,729
transformational understanding of derivatives is going to be helpful for understanding this set up,

106
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,770
but for the sake of having a point of contrast,

107
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,309
I want to show you how a problem like this is often taught using graphs.

108
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:13,939
If you were to plug in some random input to this function, the y-value tells you the corresponding output, right?

109
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,629
So to think about plugging that output back into the function,

110
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:25,370
you might first move horizontally until you hit the line y equals x and that's going to give you a position where the x-value

111
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,129
corresponds to your previous y-value, right?

112
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:34,219
So then from there you can move vertically to see what output this new x-value has

113
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,770
And then you repeat you move horizontally

114
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:42,590
to the line y = x, to find a point whose x-value is the same as the output that you just got and then

115
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,590
you move vertically to apply the function again.

116
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:50,689
Now personally, I think this is kind of an awkward way to think about repeatedly applying a function, don't you?

117
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,440
I mean it makes sense,

118
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:58,249
but you can't have to pause and think about it to remember which way to draw the lines, and you can if you want

119
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:05,179
think through what conditions make this spiderweb process narrow in on a fixed point versus propagating away from it

120
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:10,250
And in fact, go ahead pause right now and try to think it through as an exercise. It has to do with slopes

121
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,930
Or if you want to skip the exercise for something that I think gives a much more satisfying

122
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,380
understanding think about how this function acts as a transformation.

123
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:27,420
So I'm gonna go ahead and start here by drawing a whole bunch of arrows to indicate where the various sample the input points will go,

124
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,409
and side note: Don't you think this gives a really neat emergent pattern?

125
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,860
I wasn't expecting this, but it was cool to see it pop up when animating.

126
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:41,069
I guess the action of 1 divided by x gives this nice emergent circle and then we're just shifting things over by 1.

127
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:48,690
Anyway, I want you to think about what it means to repeatedly apply some function like 1 + 1/x in this context.

128
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,830
Well after letting it map all of the inputs to the outputs,

129
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:59,490
you could consider those as the new inputs and then just apply the same process again and then again and

130
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,680
Do it however many times you want

131
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,419
Notice in animating this with a few dots representing the sample points,

132
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,879
it doesn't take many iterations at all before all of those dots kind of clump in around 1.618 .

133
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:18,869
Now remember, we know that 1.618... and its little brother -0.618...

134
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:23,730
on and on stay fixed in place during each iteration of this process,

135
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:31,769
but zoom in on a neighborhood around phi during the map points in that region get contracted around phi

136
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:41,249
meaning that the function 1 + 1/x has a derivative with a magnitude that's less than 1 at this input in

137
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,040
Fact this derivative works out to be around -0.38.

138
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:48,600
So what that means, is that each repeated application

139
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,180
scrunches the neighborhood around this number smaller and smaller like a gravitational pull towards phi.

140
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,439
So now tell me what you think happens in the neighborhood of phi's little brother.

141
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:08,779
Over there the derivative actually has a magnitude larger than one, so points near the fixed point are repelled away from it and

142
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,490
When you work it out, you can see that they get stretched by more than a factor of two in each iteration.

143
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:20,479
They also get flipped around because the derivative is negative here, but the salient fact for the sake of stability is just the magnitude.

144
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:29,119
Mathematicians would call this right value a stable fixed point and the left one is an unstable fixed point

145
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,839
Something is considered stable if when you perturb it just a little bit,

146
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,720
it tends to come back towards where it started rather than going away from it.

147
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:42,280
So what we're seeing is a very useful little fact: that the stability of a fixed point is

148
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:47,480
determined by whet her or not the magnitude of its derivative is bigger or smaller than one and

149
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:52,279
this explains why phi always shows up in the numerical play where you're just hitting enter on your

150
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,399
calculator over and over but phi's little brother never does.

151
00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:00,199
Now as to whether or not you want to consider phi's little brother a valid value of the infinite fraction

152
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,560
Well, that's really up to you everything

153
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,179
we just showed suggests that if you think of this expression as representing a limiting process

154
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:13,969
then because every possible seed value other than phi's little brother gives you a series converting to φ

155
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,450
It does feel kind of silly to put them on equal footing with each other.

156
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,059
But maybe you don't think of it as a limit

157
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:26,630
Maybe the kind of math you're doing lends itself to treating this as a purely algebraic object like the solutions of a polynomial,

158
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,940
which simply has multiple values.

159
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,399
Anyway, that's beside the point and my point here is not that viewing derivatives

160
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:41,269
As this change in density is somehow better than the graphical intuition on the whole in fact picturing an entire function

161
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:44,599
this way can be kind of clunky and impractical as compared to graphs.

162
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,579
My point is that it deserves more of a mention in most of the introductory calculus courses,

163
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,959
because it can help make a student's understanding of the derivative a little bit more flexible.

164
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:59,300
Like I mentioned the real reason that I'd recommend you carry this perspective with you as you learn new

165
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:03,560
topics is not so much for what it does with your understanding of single variable calculus
