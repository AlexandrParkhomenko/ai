1
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:20,260
Here, I want to discuss one common type of
problem where integration comes up: Finding

2
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,640
the average of a continuous variable.

3
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,590
This is a useful thing to know in its own
right, but what’s really neat is that it

4
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:32,020
gives a completely different perspective for
why integrals and derivatives are inverses

5
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,230
of one and other.

6
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:40,510
Take a look at the graph of sin(x) between
0 and pi, which is half its period.

7
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,130
What is the average height of this graph on
that interval?

8
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,610
It’s not a useless question.

9
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,550
All sorts of cyclic phenomena in the world
are modeled with sine waves: For example,

10
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:56,770
the number of hours the sun is up per day
as a function of which-day-of-the-year-it-is

11
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,850
follows a sine wave pattern.

12
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:03,460
So if you wanted to predict, say, the average
effectiveness of solar panels in summer months

13
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:08,780
vs. winter months, you’d want to be able
to answer a question like this: What’s the

14
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:13,950
average value of that sine function over half
its period.

15
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:19,259
Whereas a case like that will have all sorts
of constants mucking up the function, we’ll

16
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:25,440
just focus on a pure unencumbered sin(x) function,
but the substance of the approach would be

17
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,840
the same in any application.

18
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:33,660
It’s kind of a weird thing to think about,
isn’t it, the average of a continuous variable.

19
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:39,000
Usually, with averages, we think of a finite
number of values, where you add all them up

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,580
and divide that sum by how many values there
are.

21
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:50,860
But there are infinitely many values of sin(x)
between 0 and pi, and its not like we can

22
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,550
add all those numbers and divide by infinity.

23
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:58,490
This sensation actually comes up a lot in
math, and is worth remembering, where you

24
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:04,040
have this vague sense that you want to add
together infinitely many values associated

25
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,280
with a continuum like this, even though that
doesn’t really make sense.

26
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,920
Almost always, when you get this sense, the
key will be to use an integral somehow.

27
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,340
And to think through exactly how, a good first
step is usually to approximate your situation

28
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,090
with some kind of finite sum.

29
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:27,350
In this case, imagine sampling a finite number
of points, evenly spaced in this range.

30
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:32,600
Since it’s a finite sample, you can find
the average by adding up all the heights,

31
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:39,700
sin(x), at each one, and divide that sum by
the number of points you sampled, right?

32
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,440
And presumably, if the idea of an average
height among all infinitely many points is

33
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,340
going to make any sense at all, the more points
we sample, which would involve adding up more

34
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:55,560
heights, the closer the average of that sample
should be to the actual average of the continuous

35
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,610
variable, don’t you think?

36
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:02,250
This should feel at least somewhat related
to taking an integral of sin(x) between 0

37
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,620
and pi, even if it might not be clear at first
exactly how the two ideas will match up.

38
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,360
For that integral, you also think of a sample
of inputs on this continuum, but instead of

39
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,340
adding the height sin(x) at each one, and
dividing by how many there are, you add up

40
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:25,610
sin(x)*dx where dx is the spacing between
the samples; that is, you’re adding little

41
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,030
areas, not heights.

42
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:33,330
Technically, the integral is not quite this
sum, it’s whatever that sum approaches as

43
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,650
dx approaches 0.

44
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:41,380
But it’s helpful to reason with respect
to one of these finite iterations, where you’re

45
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,440
adding the areas of some specific number of
rectangles.

46
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:52,319
So what you want to do is reframe this expression
for the average, this sum of the heights divided

47
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:59,470
by the number of sampled points, in terms
of dx, the spacing between samples.

48
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:05,060
If I tell you that the spacing between these
points is 0.1, for example, and you know that

49
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:10,380
they range from 0 to pi, can you tell me how
many there are?

50
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:17,019
Well, you can take that length of the interval,
pi, and divide it by the length of the space

51
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:19,429
between each sample.

52
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:25,030
If it doesn’t go in evenly, you’d round
down to the nearest integer, but as an approximation

53
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,290
this is fine.

54
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:32,890
So if we write the spacing between samples
as dx, the number of samples is pi/dx.

55
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:41,030
So replacing the denominator with pi/dx here,
you can rearrange, putting the dx up top and

56
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,660
distributing.

57
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:49,370
But, think about what it means to distribute
that dx up top; it means the terms you’re

58
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:56,800
adding all look like sin(x)*dx for the various
inputs x that you’re sampling, so that numerator

59
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,500
looks exactly like an integral expression.

60
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:05,490
And for larger and larger samples of points,
the average approaches the actual integral

61
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:12,020
of sin(x) between 0 and pi, all divided by
the length of that range, pi.

62
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:18,150
In other words, the average height of this
graph is this area divided by its width.

63
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:22,540
On an intuitive level, and just thinking in
terms of units, that feels pretty reasonable,

64
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,720
doesn’t it?

65
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,520
Area divided by with gives you average height.

66
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,250
So let’s actually compute this expression.

67
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:36,160
As we saw, last video, to compute an integral
you need to find an antiderivative of the

68
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,470
function inside the integral; some function
whose derivative is sin(x)

69
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:49,510
And, if you’re comfortable with trig derivatives,
you know the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x),

70
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:55,400
so if you negate that, -cos(x) is the antiderivative
of sin(x).

71
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,220
To gut check yourself on that, look at this
graph of -cos(x).

72
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:07,520
At 0, the slope is 0, then it increases to
some maximum slope at pi/2, then it goes back

73
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:14,410
down to 0 at pi, and in general its slope
does indeed seem to match the height of the

74
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:18,199
sine graph.

75
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:24,680
To evaluate the integral of sin(x) between
0 and pi, take that antiderivative at the

76
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,600
upper bound, and subtract its value at the
lower bound.

77
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,000
More visually, that’s the difference in
the height of this -cos(x) graph above pi,

78
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,120
and its height at 0, and as you can see, that
change in height is exactly 2.

79
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,639
That’s kind of interesting, isn’t it?

80
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:48,770
That the area under this sine graph turns
out to be exactly 2.

81
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:53,639
So the answer to our average height problem,
this integral divided by the width of the

82
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:59,920
region, evidently turns out to be 2/pi, which
is around 0.64.

83
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05,900
I promised at the start that this question
of finding the average value of a function

84
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,080
offers an alternate perspective on on why
integrals and derivatives are inverses of

85
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:17,370
one and other; why the area under one graph
is related to the slope of another.

86
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:23,240
Notice how finding this average value 2/pi
came down to looking at the change in the

87
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:30,919
antiderivative -cos(x) over the input range,
divided by the length of that input range.

88
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:36,259
Another way to think about that fraction is
as the rise-over-run slope between the point

89
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:41,720
of the antiderivative graph below zero, and
the point of that graph above pi.

90
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:47,610
Now think about why it might make sense that
this slope represents the average value of

91
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,509
sin(x) on that region.

92
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:56,710
By definition, sin(x) is the derivative of
this antiderivative graph; it gives the slope

93
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,760
of -cos(x) at every input.

94
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,800
So another way to think about the average
value sin(x) is as the average slope over

95
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,370
all tangent lines here between 0 and pi.

96
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:14,310
And from that view, doesn’t it make a lot
of sense that the average slope of a graph

97
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:19,500
over all its point in a certain range should
equal the total slope between the start and

98
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,650
end point?

99
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:28,400
To digest this idea, it helps to see what
it looks like for a general function.

100
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,078
For any function f(x), if you want to find
its average value on some interval, say between

101
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:40,189
a and b, what you do is take the integral
of f on that interval, divided by the width

102
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,198
of the interval.

103
00:08:43,198 --> 00:08:47,020
You can think of this as taking the area under
the graph divided by the width.

104
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:52,899
Or more accurately, it’s the signed area
of that graph, since area below the x-axis

105
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,670
is counted as negative.

106
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,720
And take a moment to remember the connection
between this idea of a continuous average

107
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,279
and the usual finite notion of an average,
where you add up many numbers and divide by

108
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,230
how many there are.

109
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:10,990
When you take some sample of points spaced
out by dx, the number of samples is about

110
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,679
the length of the interval divided by dx.

111
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:20,170
So if you add up the value of f(x) at each
sample and divide by the total number of samples,

112
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:26,749
it’s the same as adding up the products
f(x)*dx and dividing by the width of the entire

113
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:28,249
interval.

114
00:09:28,249 --> 00:09:32,379
The only difference between that and the integral
expression is that the integral asks what

115
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:37,339
happens as dx approaches 0, but that just
corresponds with samples of more and more

116
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:41,660
points that approximate the true average increasingly
well.

117
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:48,940
Like any integral, evaluating this comes down
to finding an antiderivative of f(x), commonly

118
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,550
denoted capital F(x).

119
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:58,970
In particular, what we want is the change
to this antiderivative between a and b, F(b)

120
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:04,570
- F(a), which you can think of as the change
in the height of this new graph between the

121
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,879
two bounds.

122
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:11,179
I’ve conveniently chosen an antiderivative
which passes through 0 at the lower bound

123
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:16,310
here, but keep in mind that you could freely
shift this up and down, adding whatever constant

124
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:21,360
you want to it, and it would still be a valid
antiderivative.

125
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,550
So the solution to the average problem is
the change in the height of this new graph

126
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:30,389
divided by the change to its x value between
a and b.

127
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:37,199
In other words, it’s the slope of the antiderivative
graph between these endpoints.

128
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:44,870
And again, that should make a lot of sense,
because little f(x) gives the slope of a tangent

129
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:50,870
line to this graph at each point, after all
it is by definition the derivative of capital

130
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:56,389
F.
So, why are antiderivative the key to solving

131
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,389
integrals?

132
00:10:57,389 --> 00:11:03,019
Well, my favorite intuition is still the one
I showed last video, but a second perspective

133
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:09,190
is that when you reframe the question of finding
the average of a continuous value as finding

134
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:14,959
the average slope of bunch of tangent lines,
it lets you see the answer just by the comparing

135
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:23,379
endpoints, rather than having to actually
tally up all points in between.

136
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:27,389
In the last video, I described a sensation
that should bring integrals to your mind.

137
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:31,679
Namely, if you feel like the problem you’re
solving could be approximated by breaking

138
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,709
it up somehow, and adding up a large number
of small things.

139
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:41,170
Here I want you to come away recognizing a
second sensation that should bring integrals

140
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,230
to your mind.

141
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:48,220
If there’s some idea that you understand
in a finite context, and which involves adding

142
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:53,269
up multiple values, like taking the average
of a bunch of numbers, and if you want to

143
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:59,319
generalize that idea to apply to an infinite
continuous range of values, try seeing if

144
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,910
you can phrase things in terms of an integral.

145
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:08,110
It’s a feeling that comes up enough that’s
it’s definitely worth remembering.

146
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:12,189
My thanks, as always, to those making these
videos possible.
