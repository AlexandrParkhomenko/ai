00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:08,950
Quoting Steven Strogatz, “Since Newton,
mankind has come to realize that the laws

2
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:13,750
of physics are always expressed in the language
of differential equations.” Of course, this

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,790
language is spoken well beyond the boundaries
of physics as well, and being able to speak

4
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:22,240
it and read it adds a new color to how you
view the world around you.

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,860
In the next few videos, I want to give a sort
of tour of this topic. To aim is to give a

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,810
big picture view of what this part of math
is all about, while at the same time being

7
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,560
happy to dig into the details of specific
examples as they come along.

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,829
I’ll be assuming you know the basics of
calculus, like what derivatives and integrals

9
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:43,129
are, and in later videos we’ll need some
basic linear algebra, but not much beyond

10
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:44,859
that.

11
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:49,649
Differential equations arise whenever it’s
easier to describe change than absolute amounts.

12
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:55,729
It’s easier to say why population sizes
grow or shrink than it is to describe why

13
00:00:55,729 --> 00:01:00,699
the have the particular values they do at
some point in time; It may be easier to describe

14
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:05,860
why your love for someone is changing than
why it happens to be where it is now. In physics,

15
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:11,200
more specifically Newtonian mechanics, motion
is often described in terms of force. Force

16
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,340
determines acceleration, which is a statement
about change.

17
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,820
These equations come in two flavors; Ordinary
differential equations, or ODEs, involving

18
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,730
functions with a single input, often thought
of as time, and Partial differential equations,

19
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:32,550
or PDEs, dealing with functions that have
multiple inputs. Partial derivatives are something

20
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,820
we’ll look at more closely in the next video;
you often think of them involving a whole

21
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:42,470
continuum of values changing with time, like
the temperature of every point in a solid

22
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:48,280
body, or the velocity of a fluid at every
point in space. Ordinary differential equations,

23
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,870
our focus for now, involve only a finite collection
of values changing with time.

24
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:57,420
It doesn’t have to be time, per se, your
one independent variable could be something

25
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,830
else, but things changing with time are the
prototypical and most common examples of differential

26
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,100
equations.
Physics (simple)

27
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,720
Physics offers a nice playground for us here,
with simple examples to start with, and no

28
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,730
shortage of intricacy and nuance as we delve
deeper.

29
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:18,209
As a nice warmup, consider the trajectory
of something you throw in the air. The force

30
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:25,090
of gravity near the surface of the earth causes
things to accelerate downward at 9.8 m/s per

31
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:31,270
second. Now unpack what that really means:
If you look at some object free from other

32
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:38,310
forces, and record its velocity every second,
these vectors will accrue an additional downward

33
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:47,239
component of 9.8 m/s every second. We call
this constant 9.8 “g”.

34
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:52,670
This gives an example of a differential equation,
albeit a relatively simple one. Focus on the

35
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:59,629
y-coordinate, as a function of time. It’s
derivative gives the vertical component of

36
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:10,870
velocity, whose derivative in turn gives the
vertical component of acceleration. For compactness,

37
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:15,209
let’s write this first derivative as y-dot,
and the second derivative as y-double-dot.

38
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:24,669
Our equation is simply y-double-dot = -g.
This is one where you can solve by integrating,

39
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:31,760
which is essentially working backwards. First,
what is velocity, what function has -g as

40
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:43,430
a derivative? Well, -g*t. Or rather, -g*t
+ (the initial velocity). Notice that you

41
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:49,349
have this degree of freedom which is determined
by an initial condition. Now what function

42
00:03:49,349 --> 00:04:04,209
has this as a derivative? -(½)g*t^2 + v_0
* t. Or, rather, add in a constant based on

43
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:14,379
whatever the initial position is.

44
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:19,130
Things get more interesting when the forces
acting on a body depend on where that body

45
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:24,820
is. For example, studying the motion of planets,
stars and moons, gravity can no longer be

46
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:31,260
considered a constant. Given two bodies, the
pull on one is in the direction of the other,

47
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:37,130
with a strength inversely proportional to
the square of the distance between them.

48
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:41,720
As always, the rate of change of position
is velocity, but now the rate of change of

49
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:50,320
velocity is some function of position. The
dance between these mutually-interacting variables

50
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:57,120
is mirrored in the dance between the mutually-interacting
bodies which they describe.

51
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:04,500
So often in differential equations, the puzzles
you face involve finding a function whose

52
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,540
derivative and/or higher order derivatives
are defined in terms of itself.

53
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,670
In physics, it’s most common to work with
second order differential equations, which

54
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:20,061
means the highest derivative you find in the
expression here is a second derivative. Higher

55
00:05:20,061 --> 00:05:24,510
order differential equations would be ones
with third derivatives, fourth derivatives

56
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,790
and so on; puzzles with more intricate clues.

57
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:36,620
The sensation here is one of solving an infinite
continuous jigsaw puzzle. In a sense you have

58
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:43,440
to find infinitely many numbers, one for each
point in time, constrained by a very specific

59
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,590
way that these values intertwine with their
own rate of change, and the rate of change

60
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,090
of that rate of change.

61
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:58,140
I want you to take some time digging in to
a deceptively simple example: A pendulum.

62
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:04,210
How does this angle theta that it makes with
the vertical change as a function of time.

63
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:09,121
This is often given as an example in introductory
physics classes of harmonic motion, meaning

64
00:06:09,121 --> 00:06:17,840
it oscillates like a sine wave. More specifically,
one with a period of 2pi * L/g, where L is

65
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,750
the length of the pendulum, and g is gravity.

66
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:28,050
However, these formulas are actually lies.
Or, rather, approximations which only work

67
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:33,670
in the realm of small angles. If you measured
an actual pendulum, you’d find that when

68
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:38,860
you pull it out farther, the period is longer
than what that high-school physics formulas

69
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:48,800
would suggest. And when you pull it really
far out, the value of theta vs. time doesn’t

70
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:56,950
even look like a sine wave anymore.

71
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,910
First thing’s first, let’s set up the
differential equation. We’ll measure its

72
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:07,200
position as a distance x along this arc. If
the angle theta we care about is measured

73
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:13,370
in radians, we can write x and L*theta, where
L is the length of the pendulum.

74
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:18,680
As usual, gravity pulls down with acceleration
g, but because the pendulum constrains the

75
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,870
motion of this mass, we have to look at the
component of this acceleration in the direction

76
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:29,730
of motion. A little geometry exercise for
you is to show that this little angle here

77
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:38,650
is the same as our theta. So the component
of gravity in the direction of motion, opposite

78
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:42,170
this angle, will be -g*sin(theta).

79
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:50,340
Here we’re considering theta to be positive
when the pendulum is swung to the right, and

80
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:55,420
negative when it’s swung to the left, and
this negative sign in the acceleration indicates

81
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:00,139
that it’s always pointed in the opposite
direction from displacement.

82
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:16,460
So the second derivative

83
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:30,510
of x, the acceleration, is -g*sin(theta).
Since x is L*theta, that means the second

84
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:38,400
derivative of theta is -(g/L) * sin(theta).
To be somewhat more realistic, let’s add

85
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,820
in a term to account for air resistance, which
perhaps we model as being proportional to

86
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:52,301
the velocity. We write this as -mu * theta-dot,
where -mu is some constant determining how

87
00:08:52,301 --> 00:08:55,940
quickly the pendulum loses energy.

88
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:02,640
This is a particularly juicy differential
equation. Not easy to solve, but not so hard

89
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,380
that we can’t reasonably get some meaningful
understanding of it.

90
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:11,880
At first you might think that this sine function
relates to the sine wave pattern for the pendulum.

91
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,850
Ironically, though, what you'll eventually
find is that the opposite is true. The presence

92
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,850
of the sine in this equation is precisely
why the real pendulum doesn't oscillate with

93
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,500
the sine wave pattern.

94
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:28,440
If that sounds odd, consider the fact that
here, the sine function takes theta as an

95
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:36,950
input, but the approximate solution has the
value theta itself oscillating as a sine wave.

96
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,760
Clearly something fishy is afoot.

97
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,581
One thing I like about this example is that
even though it’s comparatively simple, it

98
00:09:43,581 --> 00:09:47,980
exposes an important truth about differential
equations that you need to be grapple with:

99
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,410
They’re really freaking hard to solve.

100
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:55,700
In this case, if we remove the damping term,
we can just barely write down an analytic

101
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:00,450
solution, but it’s hilariously complicated,
involving all these functions you’re probably

102
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:05,960
never heard of written in terms of integrals
and weird inverse integral problems.

103
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:11,580
Presumably, the reason for finding a solution
is to then be able to make computations, and

104
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:16,270
to build an understanding for whatever dynamics
your studying. In a case like this, those

105
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:22,030
questions have just been punted off to figuring
out how to compute and understand these new

106
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,260
functions.

107
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:29,010
And more often, like if we add back this dampening
term, there is not a known way to write down

108
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:34,120
an exact solution analytically. Well, for
any hard problem you could just define a new

109
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:39,300
function to be the answer to that problem.
Heck, even name it after yourself if you want.

110
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,840
But again, that’s pointless unless it leads
you to being able to compute and understand

111
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,020
the answer.

112
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:50,620
So instead, in studying differential equations,
we often do a sort of short-circuit and skip

113
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:56,930
the actual solution part, and go straight
to building understanding and making computations

114
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:01,480
from the equations alone. Let me walk through
what that might look like with the Pendulum.

115
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,340
Phase space
What do you hold in your head, or what visualization

116
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,830
could you get some software to pull up for
you, to understand the many possible ways

117
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:15,750
a pendulum governed by these laws might evolve
depending on its starting conditions?

118
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,550
You might be tempted to try imagining the
graph of theta(t), and somehow interpreting

119
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:26,460
how its position, slope, and curvature all
inter-relate. However, what will turn out

120
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:32,190
to be both easier and more general is to start
by visualizing all possible states of the

121
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:37,310
system in a 2d plane.

122
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:42,820
The state of the pendulum can be fully described
by two numbers, the angle, and the angular

123
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:49,100
velocity. You can freely change these two
values without necessarily changing the other,

124
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:54,580
but the acceleration is purely a function
of these two values. So each point of this

125
00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:00,430
2d plane fully describes the pendulum at a
given moment. You might think of these as

126
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:06,920
all possible initial conditions of the pendulum.
If you know this initial angle and angular

127
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:14,350
velocity, that’s enough to predict how the
system will evolve as time moves forward.

128
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,300
If you haven’t worked with them, these sorts
of diagrams can take a little getting used

129
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:23,339
to. What you’re looking at now, this inward
spiral, is a fairly typical trajectory for

130
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:30,420
our pendulum, so take a moment to think carefully
about what’s being represented. Notice how

131
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:38,330
at the start, as theta decreases, theta-dot
gets more negative, which makes sense because

132
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:43,510
the pendulum moves faster in the leftward
direction as it approaches the bottom. Keep

133
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:48,149
in mind, even though the velocity vector on
this pendulum is pointed to the left, the

134
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:54,620
value of that velocity is being represented
by the vertical component of our space. It’s

135
00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:00,770
important to remind yourself that this state
space is abstract, and distinct from the physical

136
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:04,980
space where the pendulum lives and moves.

137
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:10,250
Since we’re modeling it as losing some energy
to air resistance, this trajectory spirals

138
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:16,870
inward, meaning the peak velocity and displacement
each go down by a bit with each swing. Our

139
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:26,240
point is, in a sense, attracted to the origin
where theta and theta-dot both equal 0.

140
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,000
With this space, we can visualize a differential
equation as a vector field. Here, let me show

141
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
you what I mean.

142
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,160
The pendulum state is this vector, [theta,
theta-dot]. Maybe you think of it as an arrow,

143
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:45,110
maybe as a point; what matters is that it
has two coordinates, each a function of time.

144
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:49,950
Taking the derivative of that vector gives
you its rate of change; the direction and

145
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:56,430
speed that it will tend to move in this diagram.
That derivative is a new vector, [theta-dot,

146
00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:03,990
theta-double-dot], which we visualize as being
attached to the relevant point in this space.

147
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,430
Take a moment to interpret what this is saying.

148
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:14,290
The first component for this rate-of-change
vector is theta-dot, so the higher up we are

149
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:19,860
on the digram, the more the point tends to
move to the right, and the lower we are, the

150
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:28,050
more it tends to move to the left. The vertical
component is theta-double-dot, which our differential

151
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:33,839
equation lets us rewrite entirely in terms
of theta and theta-dot. In other words, the

152
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:42,050
first derivative of our state vector is some
function of that vector itself.

153
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:46,600
Doing the same at all points of this space
will show how the state tends to change from

154
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:53,480
any position, artificially scaling down the
vectors when we draw them to prevent clutter,

155
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,120
but using color to loosely indicate magnitude.

156
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,920
Notice that we’ve effectively broken up
a single second order equation into a system

157
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,160
of two first order equations. You might even
give theta-dot a different name to emphasize

158
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:12,490
that we’re thinking of two separate values,
intertwined via this mutual effect they have

159
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:17,330
on one and other’s rate of change. This
is a common trick in the study of differential

160
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:21,910
equations, instead of thinking about higher
order changes of a single value, we often

161
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:26,060
prefer to think of the first derivative of
vector values.

162
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:31,529
In this form, we have a nice visual way to
think about what solving our equation means:

163
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:37,230
As our system evolves from some initial state,
our point in this space will move along some

164
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:43,100
trajectory in such a way that at every moment,
the velocity of that point matches the vector

165
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:48,680
from this vector field. Keep in mind, this
velocity is not the same thing as the physical

166
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:54,620
velocity of our pendulum. It’s a more abstract
rate of change encoding the changes in both

167
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,339
theta and theta-dot.

168
00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:01,060
You might find it fun to pause for a moment
and think through what exactly some of these

169
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:09,650
trajectory lines say about possible ways the
pendulum evolves for different starting conditions.

170
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:14,709
For example, in regions where theta-dot is
quite high, the vectors guide the point to

171
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:20,390
travel to the right quite a ways before settling
down into an inward spiral. This corresponds

172
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:26,110
to a pendulum with a high initial velocity,
fully rotating around several times before

173
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:31,660
settling down into a decaying back and forth.

174
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:37,720
Having a little more fun, when I tweak this
air resistance term mu, say increasing it,

175
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:43,010
you can immediately see how this will result
in trajectories that spiral inward faster,

176
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:51,850
which is to say the pendulum slows down faster.
Imagine you saw the equations out of context,

177
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:57,030
not knowing they described a pendulum; it’s
not obvious just-looking at them that increasing

178
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:04,119
the value of mu means the system tends towards
some attracting state faster, so getting some

179
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:08,149
software to draw these vector fields for you
can be a great way to gain an intuition for

180
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,609
how they behave.

181
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:14,889
What’s wonderful is that any system of ordinary
differential equations can be described by

182
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:19,300
a vector field like this, so it’s a very
general way to get a feel for them.

183
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:25,130
Usually, though, they have many more dimensions.
For example, consider the famous three-body

184
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:30,510
problem, which is to predict how three masses
in 3d space will evolve if they act on each

185
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:35,440
other with gravity, and you know their initial
positions and velocities.

186
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,230
Each mass has three coordinates describing
its position and three more describing its

187
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:46,570
momentum, so the system has 18 degrees of
freedom, and hence an 18-dimensional space

188
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:52,280
of possible states. It’s a bizarre thought,
isn’t it? A single point meandering through

189
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:57,600
and 18-dimensional space we cannot visualize,
obediently taking steps through time based

190
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,080
on whatever vector it happens to be sitting
on from moment to moment, completely encoding

191
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,950
the positions and momenta of 3 masses in ordinary,
physical, 3d space.

192
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:12,309
(In practice, by the way, you can reduce this
number of dimension by taking advantage of

193
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:16,910
the symmetries in your setup, but the point
of more degrees of freedom resulting in a

194
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,590
higher-dimensional state space remains the
same).

195
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:26,260
In math, we often call a space like this a
“phase space”. You’ll hear me use the

196
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,670
term broadly for spaces encoding all kinds
of states for changing systems, but you should

197
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:35,950
know that in the context of physics, especially
Hamiltonian mechanics, the term is often reserved

198
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:42,020
for a special case. Namely, a space whose
axes represent position and momentum.

199
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:47,470
So a physicist would agree that the 18-dimension
space describing the 3-body problem is a phase

200
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:52,020
space, but they might ask that we make a couple
of modifications to our pendulum set up for

201
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,910
it to properly deserve the term. For those
of you who watched the block collision videos,

202
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:01,100
the planes we worked with there would happily
be called phase spaces by math folk, though

203
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,920
a physicist might prefer other terminology.
Just know that the specific meaning may depend

204
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,980
on your context.

205
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,340
It may seem like a simple idea, depending
on how well indoctrinated you are to modern

206
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:16,610
ways of thinking about math, but it’s worth
keeping in mind that it took humanity quite

207
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:22,210
a while to really embrace thinking of dynamics
spatially like this, especially when the dimensions

208
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:28,900
get very large. In his book Chaos, James Gleick
describes phase space as “one of the most

209
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,770
powerful inventions of modern science.”

210
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:36,450
One reason it’s powerful is that you can
ask questions not just about a single initial

211
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:42,920
state, but a whole spectrum of initial states.
The collection of all possible trajectories

212
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,140
is reminiscent of a moving fluid, so we call
it phase flow.

213
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:54,570
To take one example of why phase flow is a
fruitful formulation, the origin of our space

214
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:59,600
corresponds to the pendulum standing still;
and so does this point over here, representing

215
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:05,900
when the pendulum is balanced upright. These
are called fixed points of the system, and

216
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:10,860
one natural question to ask is whether they
are stable. That is, will tiny nudges to the

217
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:16,511
system result in a state that tends back towards
the stable point or away from it. Physical

218
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:20,770
intuition for the pendulum makes the answer
here obvious, but how would you think about

219
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:25,840
stability just by looking at the equations,
say if they arose from some completely different

220
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,460
and less intuitive context?

221
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,830
We’ll go over how to compute the answer
to a question like this in following videos,

222
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:36,340
and the intuition for the relevant computations
are guided heavily by the thought of looking

223
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:41,330
at a small region in this space around the
fixed point and asking about whether the flow

224
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:45,630
contracts or expands its points.

225
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:50,590
Speaking of attraction and stability, let’s
take a brief sidestep to talk about love.

226
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:54,730
The Strogatz quote I referenced earlier comes
from a whimsical column in the New York Times

227
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:59,610
on mathematical models of love, an example
well worth pilfering to illustrate that we’re

228
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,850
not just talking about physics.

229
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:05,610
Imagine you’ve been flirting with someone,
but there’s been some frustrating inconsistency

230
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:10,429
to how mutual the affections seem. And perhaps
during a moment when you turn your attention

231
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:14,450
towards physics to keep your mind off this
romantic turmoil, mulling over your broken

232
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:19,770
up pendulum equations, you suddenly understand
the on-again-off-again dynamics of your flirtation.

233
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:24,950
You’ve noticed that your own affections
tend to increase when your companion seems

234
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:31,640
interested in you, but decrease when they
seem colder. That is, the rate of change for

235
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,330
your love is proportional to their feelings
for you.

236
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:40,900
But this sweetheart of yours is precisely
the opposite: Strangely attracted to you when

237
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:46,460
you seem uninterested, but turned off once
you seem too keen.

238
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:50,960
The phase space for these equations looks
very similar to the center part of your pendulum

239
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,660
diagram. The two of you will go back and forth
between affection and repulsion in an endless

240
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:03,200
cycle. A metaphor of pendulum swings in your
feelings would not just be apt, but mathematically

241
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,290
verified. In fact, if your partner’s feelings
were further slowed when they feel themselves

242
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:12,510
too in love, let’s say out of a fear of
being made vulnerable, we’d have a term

243
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:17,070
matching the friction of your pendulum, and
you two would be destined to an inward spiral

244
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:21,400
towards mutual ambivalence. I hear wedding
bells already.

245
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,760
The point is that two very different-seeming
laws of dynamics, one from physics initially

246
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:32,419
involving a single variable, and another from...er...chemistry
with two variables, actually have a very similar

247
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:38,160
structure, easier to recognize when looking
at their phase spaces. Most notably, even

248
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:43,000
though the equations are different, for example
there’s no sine in your companion’s equation,

249
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,290
the phase space exposes an underlying similarity
nevertheless.

250
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:51,310
In other words, you’re not just studying
a pendulum right now, the tactics you develop

251
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:56,500
to study one case have a tendency to transfer
to many others.

252
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:02,179
Okay, so phase diagrams are a nice way to
build understanding, but what about actually

253
00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:07,930
computing the answer to our equation? Well,
one way to do this is to essentially simulate

254
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:12,679
what the world will do, but using finite time
steps instead of the infinitesimals and limits

255
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:14,400
defining calculus.

256
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,290
The basic idea is that if you’re at some
point on this phase diagram, take a step based

257
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:24,201
on whatever vector your sitting on for some
small time step, delta-t. Specifically, take

258
00:23:24,201 --> 00:23:30,760
a step of delta-T times that vector. Remember,
in drawing this vector field, the magnitude

259
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:36,419
of each vector has been artificially scaled
down to prevent clutter. Do this repeatedly,

260
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:42,850
and your final location will be an approximation
of theta(t), where t is the sum of all your

261
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,490
time steps.

262
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:48,520
If you think about what’s being shown right
now, and what that would imply for the pendulum’s

263
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:53,210
movement, you’d probably agree it’s grossly
inaccurate. But that’s just because the

264
00:23:53,210 --> 00:24:01,380
timestep delta-t of 0.5 is way too big. If
we turn it down, say to 0.01, you can get

265
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,920
a much more accurate approximation, it just
takes many more repeated steps is all. In

266
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:12,090
this case, computing theta(10) requires a
thousand little steps. Luckily, we live in

267
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:17,179
a world with computers, so repeating a simple
task 1,000 times is as simple as articulating

268
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:19,770
that task with a programming language.

269
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:26,380
In fact, let’s write a little python program
that computes theta(t) for us. It will make

270
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:31,720
use of the differential equation, which returns
the second derivative of theta as a function

271
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:38,549
of theta and theta-dot. You start by defining
two variables, theta and theta-dot, in terms

272
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:44,549
of some initial values. In this case I’ll
choose pi / 3, which is 60-degrees, and 0

273
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:47,039
for the angular velocity.

274
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:53,480
Next, write a loop which corresponds to many
little time steps between 0 and 10, each of

275
00:24:53,480 --> 00:25:01,500
size delta-t, which I’m setting to be 0.01
here. In each step of the loop, increase theta

276
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:08,500
by theta-dot times delta-t, and increase theta-dot
by theta-double-dot times delta-t, where theta-double-dot

277
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:14,559
can be computed based on the differential
equation. After all these little steps, simple

278
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,720
return the value of theta.

279
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,230
This is called solving the differential equation
numerically. Numerical methods can get way

280
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:26,230
more sophisticated and intricate to better
balance the tradeoff between accuracy and

281
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:30,580
efficiency, but this loop gives the basic
idea.

282
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:35,010
So even though it sucks that we can’t always
find exact solutions, there are still meaningful

283
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:38,970
ways to study differential equations in the
face of this inability.

284
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:43,790
In the following videos, we will look at several
methods for finding exact solutions when it’s

285
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:48,740
possible. But one theme I’d like to focus
is on is how these exact solutions can also

286
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,340
help us study the more general unsolvable
cases.

287
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:58,130
But it gets worse. Just as there is a limit
to how far exact analytic solutions can get

288
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:03,160
us, one of the great fields to have emerged
in the last century, chaos theory, has exposed

289
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:07,060
that there are further limits on how well
we can use these systems for prediction, with

290
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:12,750
or without exact solutions. Specifically,
we know that for some systems, small variations

291
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:18,330
to the initial conditions, say the kind due
to necessarily imperfect measurements, result

292
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:22,400
in wildly different trajectories. We’ve
even built some good understanding for why

293
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,700
this happens. The three body problem, for
example, is known to have seeds of chaos within

294
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,940
it.

295
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,600
So looking back at that quote from earlier,
it seems almost cruel of the universe to fill

296
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,900
its language with riddles that we either can’t
solve, or where we know that any solution

297
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:43,549
would be useless for long-term prediction
anyway. It is cruel, but then again, that

298
00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:48,650
should be reassuring. It gives some hope that
the complexity we see in the world can be

299
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:53,490
studied somewhere in the math, and that it’s
not hidden away in some mismatch between model

300
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,130
and reality.
