Consider the following text: 

“I love playing football and also love playing basketball. I love how playing helps me keep fit.”

What is the Bigram Probability of “love playing”?

1
2/3

1/3




A co-occurrence matrix is needed to be built following a word by word design with a window size of 5 (k = 5). Consider the following sentence:

“I love cooking and experimenting with new recipes. I try cooking without following the traditional recipes. For me cooking is an art. So I don’t bother experimenting with my own recipes while cooking.”

Given the above sentence, which of the following is the value for the co-occurrence of “cooking” and “ recipes” when the window size is 5?

3
1
4
5





Consider the following sentence: 
                “It is going to rain today”
Which of the following can be calculated using Language Models? (Select all that apply)

P(“is” | “I”)
P(“today” | “It is going to rain”)
P(“It is going to rain today”) > P(“It is going to rain yesterday”)
P(“It is going to rain today”)







A hypothetical two-dimensional vector space represents different countries (A, B, C, D) and their currencies (W, X, Y, Z). Consider the following table:


Country     Currency

A (1, 13)   U (7,19)
B (3, 7)    W (8, 7)
C (2, 4)    X (8, 4)
D (2, 1)    Y (8, 15)
E (3, 15)   Z (9, 12)
	





If Y is the currency of country A, then taking into consideration the vector representation in the table given above, W will be the currency of :

B.

D.

E.

C.
